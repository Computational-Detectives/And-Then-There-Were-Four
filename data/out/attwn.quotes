811	844	808	808	she	129	" But I 'm lucky to have even this . After all , people do n't like a Coroner 's Inquest , even if the Coroner did acquit me of all blame ! "
1042	1061	1037	1037	She	129	" I bet he 's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some interesting things ... "
1084	1092	1082	1082	himself	69	" Quite attractive a bit schoolmistressy perhaps ... "

1181	1188	1176	1176	He	69	" A hundred guineas , eh ? "
1262	1273	1253	1253	He	69	" And you ca n't give me any further information ? "
1286	1321	1274	1276	Mr. Isaac Morris	73	" No , Captain Lombard , the matter rests there . It is understood by my client that your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place . I am empowered to hand

1382	1387	1377	1377	Lombard	71	" For how long ? "
1388	1397	1377	1377	Lombard	71	" Not longer than a week at most . "
1407	1417	1403	1404	Captain Lombard	71	" You understand I ca n't undertake anything illegal ? "
1453	1473	1449	1449	he	73	" If anything illegal is proposed , you will , of course , be at perfect liberty to withdraw . "
1914	1924	1909	1910	Emily Brent	74	" So many people write their signatures quite illegibly . "

3382	3390	3391	3391	he	89	" Job ought to be easy enough , "
3394	3412	3391	3391	he	89	" Do n't see how I can slip up on it . Hope I look all right . "
3456	3462	3464	3465	Mr. Blore	89	" Might be a Major , "
3467	3486	3464	3465	Mr. Blore	89	" No , I forgot . There 's that old military gent . He 'd spot me at once .
3487	3491	3493	3494	Mr. Blore	89	" South Africa , "
3496	3532	3493	3494	Mr. Blore	89	" that 's my line ! None of these people have anything to do with South Africa , and I 've just been reading that travel folder so I can talk about it all right . "
3642	3652	3631	3636	The old man in the corner	348	" You ca n't never tell at sea never ! "
3658	3667	3653	3654	Mr. Blore	89	" That 's right . You ca n't . "
3677	3684	3668	3670	The old man	349	" There 's a squall coming . "
3689	3702	3685	3686	Mr. Blore	89	" No , no , mate , it 's a lovely day . "
3709	3721	3703	3705	The old man	349	" There 's a squall ahead . I can smell it . "
3722	3728	3730	3731	Mr. Blore	89	" Maybe you 're right , "
3747	3754	3755	3755	He	353	" Thish where I get out . "

3979	4013	3960	3961	The driver	362	" There are two taxis here , sir . One of them must wait till the slow train from Exeter gets in a matter of five minutes there 's one gentleman coming by that .
4031	4031	4023	4023	You	364	"
4048	4053	4054	4054	she	129	" I 'll wait , "
4057	4064	4065	4065	She	129	" if you will go on ? "

4193	4200	4184	4186	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Beautiful weather we are having . "
4205	4210	4201	4202	Miss Brent	74	" Yes , indeed . "
4248	4259	4243	4245	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4260	4282	4283	4284	The judge	375	" I have been to Cornwall and to Torquay , but this is my first visit to this part of Devon . "
4287	4299	4283	4284	The judge	375	" I also am unacquainted with this part of the world . "
4313	4323	4305	4310	The driver of the second taxi	377	" Like to sit inside while you 're waiting ? "
4328	4333	4324	4324	Vera	129	" Not at all . "
4341	4358	4338	4338	He	377	" That sunny wall looks more attractive . Unless you 'd rather go inside the station ? "
4359	4376	4305	4310	The driver of the second taxi	377	" No , indeed . It 's so delightful to get out of that stuffy train . "
4380	4393	4377	4377	He	377	" Yes , travelling by train is rather trying in this weather . "
4398	4417	4394	4394	Vera	129	" I do hope it lasts the weather , I mean . Our English summers are so treacherous . "
4427	4438	4424	4424	Lombard	71	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4439	4449	4450	4450	She	129	" No , I 've never been here before . "
4464	4474	4450	4450	She	129	" I have n't even seen my employer yet . "
4475	4479	4424	4424	Lombard	71	" Your employer ? "
4480	4490	4450	4450	She	129	" Yes , I 'm Mrs. Owen 's secretary . "
4491	4497	4424	4424	Lombard	71	" Oh , I see . "
4516	4523	4513	4513	He	71	" Is n't that rather unusual ? "
4527	4559	4524	4524	Vera	129	" Oh , no , I do n't think so . Her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she wired to an agency for a substitute and they sent me . "
4560	4580	4450	4450	She	129	" So that was it . And suppose you do n't like the post when you 've got there ? "
4585	4605	4581	4581	Vera	129	" Oh , it 's only temporary a holiday post . I 've got a permanent job at a girls '
4643	4643	4524	4524	Vera	129	"
4647	4659	4644	4644	Lombard	71	" I do n't know . I have n't seen it . "
4660	4685	4644	4644	Lombard	71	" Oh , really ? The Owens are frightfully keen on it , I suppose . What are they like ? Do tell me . "
4689	4703	4686	4686	Lombard	71	" Awkward , this am I supposed to have met them or not ? "
4708	4723	4704	4704	He	71	" There 's a wasp crawling up your arm . No keep quite still . "
4730	4737	4724	4724	He	71	" There . It 's gone ! "
4738	4754	4644	4644	Lombard	71	" Oh , thank you . There are a lot of wasps about this summer . "
4755	4775	4724	4724	He	71	" Yes , I suppose it 's the heat . Who are we waiting for , do you know ? "
4776	4784	4644	4644	Lombard	71	" I have n't the least idea . "
4800	4808	4797	4797	Lombard	71	" That will be the train now . "
4871	4886	4887	4887	She	129	" I am Mrs. Owen 's secretary . There is a car here waiting . "
4890	4896	4887	4887	She	129	" This is Mr. Lombard . "
4930	4942	4924	4928	any one to read it	382	" Goodlooking fellow . Something just a little wrong about him ... "
4994	5019	4990	4991	General Macarthur	78	" Do n't know this part of Devon at all . My little place is in East Devon just on the borderline of Dorset . "
5023	5044	5020	5020	Vera	129	" It really is lovely here . The hills and the red earth and everything so green and luscious looking . "
5050	5072	5045	5046	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's a bit shut in ... I like open country myself . Where you can see what 's coming ... "
5079	5092	5073	5074	General Macarthur	78	" You 've seen a bit of the world , I fancy ? "
5099	5110	5093	5093	Lombard	69	" I 've knocked about here and there , sir . "
5116	5132	5111	5111	He	69	" He 'll ask me now if I was old enough to be in the War .
5139	5139	5133	5135	These old boys	388	"
5210	5218	5205	5205	Vera	129	" It 's a long way out . "
5316	5326	5327	5327	he	404	" Thought we might as well wait for you , "
5330	5360	5327	5327	he	404	" Make one trip of it . Allow me to introduce myself . Name 's Davis . Natal , South Africa 's my natal spot , ha , ha ! "
5402	5414	5416	5417	Mr. Davis	95	" Any one care for a little nip before we embark ? "
5435	5452	5453	5453	he	95	" Must n't delay , then . Our good host and hostess will be expecting us , "
5553	5589	5545	5545	He	345	" Will you be ready to be starting for the island , ladies and gentlemen ? The boat 's waiting . There 's two gentlemen coming by car , but Mr. Owen 's orders was not to
5601	5601	5548	5548	his	345	"
5629	5637	5625	5626	Emily Brent	74	" That 's a very small boat . "
5645	5668	5638	5641	The boat 's owner	420	" She 's a fine boat , that , Ma'am . You could go to Plymouth in her as easy as winking . "
5675	5684	5669	5671	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" There are a good many of us . "
5685	5695	5700	5700	his	69	" She 'd take double the number , sir . "
5705	5717	5700	5700	his	69	" It 's quite all right . Glorious weather no swell . "
6439	6450	6434	6435	Philip Lombard	69	" Must be difficult to land here in dirty weather . "
6456	6480	6451	6452	Fred Narracott	97	" Ca n't land on Indian Island when there 's a southeasterly . Sometimes ' tis cut off for a week or more . "
6485	6502	6481	6482	Vera Claythorne	129	" The catering must be very difficult . That 's the worst of an island . All the
6509	6509	6544	6544	he	97	"
6559	6565	6555	6556	General Macarthur	78	" Ha , delightful spot ! "
6657	6666	6654	6654	He	493	" Will you come this way , please ? "
6743	6754	6737	6739	the butler chap	497	" Mr. Owen unfortunately delayed unable to get here till tomorrow .
6777	6777	6737	6739	the butler chap	497	"
6835	6847	6830	6831	Mrs. Rogers	90	" I hope you 've got everything you want , Miss ? "
6884	6892	6880	6880	She	100	" Yes , everything , I think . "
6893	6906	6907	6908	Mrs. Rogers	90	" You 'll ring the bell if you want anything , Miss ? "
6963	6972	6960	6960	Vera	100	" She looks frightened of her own shadow . "
7013	7028	7009	7009	She	100	" I 'm Mrs. Owen 's new secretary . I expect you know that . "
7033	7060	7029	7030	Mrs. Rogers	90	" No , Miss , I do n't know anything . Just a list of the ladies and gentlemen and what rooms they were to have . "
7064	7072	7061	7061	Vera	100	" Mrs. Owen did n't mention me ? "
7079	7097	7073	7074	Mrs. Rogers	90	" I have n't seen Mrs. Owen not yet . We only came here two days ago . "
7098	7105	7107	7107	Vera	100	" Extraordinary people , these Owens , "
7113	7120	7110	7110	she	100	" What staff is there here ? "
7121	7128	7129	7129	Vera	100	" Just me and Rogers , Miss. "
7157	7189	7153	7154	Mrs. Rogers	90	" I 'm a good cook and Rogers is handy about the house . I did n't know , of course , that there was to be such a large party . "
7193	7199	7153	7154	Mrs. Rogers	90	" But you can manage ? "
7200	7228	7153	7154	Mrs. Rogers	90	" Oh , yes , Miss , I can manage . If there 's to be large parties often perhaps Mrs. Owen could get extra help in . "
7232	7237	7229	7229	Vera	100	" I expect so . "
7319	7337	7316	7316	Vera	100	" I wish I 'd seen the Owens ... I wish I knew what they were like . "
7925	7960	7922	7922	He	81	" All the same , this evening , I 'll imagine to myself that I 'm not going back that I 've done with London and Harley Street and all the rest of it . "
8004	8014	8001	8001	He	81	" I 'm leaving my ordinary life behind me . "
8190	8205	8188	8188	himself	53	" Armstrong ? Remember him in the witness box . Very correct and cautious . All
8221	8242	8188	8188	himself	53	" And his mind dwelt malevolently on a recent interview he had had with a suave personage in that very street .
8247	8254	8244	8244	he	53	" Drinks are in the hall . "
8259	8273	8255	8256	Dr. Armstrong	81	" I must go and pay my respects to my host and hostess . "
8289	8296	8278	8278	his	53	" You ca n't do that . "
8302	8306	8297	8298	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Why not ? "
8311	8329	8307	8308	The judge	375	" No host and hostess . Very curious state of affairs . Do n't understand this place . "
8355	8361	8351	8351	Wargrave	53	" D'you know Constance Culmington ? "
8362	8373	8307	8308	The judge	375	" Er no , I 'm afraid I do n't . "
8374	8381	8383	8384	the judge	375	" It 's of no consequence , "
8386	8408	8383	8384	the judge	375	" Very vague woman and practically unreadable handwriting . I was just wondering if I 'd come to the wrong house . "
8512	8523	8507	8508	the Judge	375	" Is Lady Constance Culmington expected , do you know ? "
8529	8539	8524	8524	Rogers	90	" No , sir , not to my knowledge . "
8554	8568	8547	8547	he	375	" Indian Island , eh ? There 's a nigger in the woodpile . "
8617	8627	8612	8612	He	88	" Must go through with it , I suppose , "
8740	8779	8737	8737	He	89	" Remember this island when I was a kid . Never thought I 'd be doing this sort of a job in a house here . Good thing , perhaps , that one ca n't foresee the future ... "
8967	9002	8962	8962	she	589	" The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken . The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth :
9023	9023	9015	9016	The wicked	591	"
9196	9206	9191	9192	Anthony Marston	88	" Quaint , these things , are n't they ? "
9227	9230	9232	9232	Tony	86	" Indians . "
9234	9245	9232	9232	Tony	86	" Indian Island . I suppose that 's the idea . "
9250	9261	9191	9192	Anthony Marston	88	" I wonder . How many are there ? Ten ? "
9262	9268	9232	9232	Tony	86	" Yes ten there are . "
9272	9305	9269	9269	Vera	129	" What fun ! They 're the ten little Indian boys of the nursery rhyme , I suppose . In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece . "
9309	9316	9306	9306	Lombard	69	" In my room , too . "
9317	9321	9269	9269	Vera	129	" And mine . "
9322	9326	9306	9306	Lombard	69	" And mine . "
9335	9346	9332	9332	Vera	129	" It 's an amusing idea , is n't it ? "
9352	9356	9359	9359	himself	53	" Remarkably childish , "
9413	9417	9409	9410	Emily Brent	74	" Pleasant sound . "
9422	9427	9418	9418	Vera	129	" I hate it . "
9447	9462	9441	9441	She	129	" I do n't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm . "
9467	9480	9481	9481	she	74	" I 've no doubt the house is shut up in winter , "
9484	9497	9481	9481	she	74	" You 'd never get servants to stay here for one thing . "
9501	9511	9498	9498	Vera	129	" It must be difficult to get servants anyway . "
9516	9534	9512	9513	Emily Brent	74	" Mrs. Oliver has been lucky to get these two . The woman 's a good cook . "
9538	9548	9535	9535	Vera	129	" Funny how elderly people always get names wrong . "
9552	9565	9549	9549	She	129	" Yes , I think Mrs. Owen has been very lucky indeed . "
9598	9606	9594	9594	She	74	" Owen ? Did you say Owen ? "
9607	9610	9594	9594	She	74	" Yes . "
9616	9629	9611	9612	Emily Brent	74	" I 've never met any one called Owen in my life . "
9633	9636	9630	9630	Vera	129	" But surely "
9831	9840	9821	9822	The Voice	109	" Ladies and gentlemen ! Silence , please ! "
10187	10190	10184	10184	Lombard	69	" Marston . "
10236	10257	10232	10232	He	81	" It 's nothing . She 's fainted , that 's all . She 'll be round in a minute . "
10263	10268	10258	10258	Lombard	69	" Get some brandy . "
10281	10286	10269	10269	Rogers	90	" Yes , sir , "
10299	10313	10295	10295	Vera	129	" Who was that speaking ? Where was he ? It sounded it sounded "
10319	10335	10314	10315	General Macarthur	104	" What 's going on here ? What kind of a practical joke was that ? "
10464	10478	10461	10461	He	69	" That voice ? It sounded as though it were in the room . "
10482	10498	10479	10479	Vera	129	" Who was it ? Who was it ? It was n't one of us . "
10580	10587	10577	10577	He	69	" Ah , here we are . "
10687	10695	10674	10674	he	69	" You are charged with the following indictments "
10699	10712	10696	10696	Vera	129	" Turn it off ! Turn it off ! It 's horrible ! "
10726	10737	10716	10717	Dr. Armstrong	81	" A disgraceful and heartless practical joke , I suppose . "
10748	10760	10743	10745	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" So you think it 's a joke , do you ? "
10767	10774	10761	10762	The doctor	310	" What else could it be ? "
10789	10802	10786	10786	He	69	" At the moment I 'm not prepared to give an opinion . "
10811	10835	10808	10808	He	116	" Look here , there 's one thing you 've forgotten . Who the devil turned the thing on and set it going ? "
10839	10850	10851	10851	He	53	" Yes , I think we must inquire into that . "
10895	10925	10888	10888	Rogers	90	" Allow me , Madam , I 'll speak to her . Ethel Ethel it 's all right . All right , do you hear ? Pull yourself together . "
10959	10966	10935	10935	Her	90	" Pull yourself together , Ethel . "
10974	10990	10967	10968	Dr. Armstrong	81	" You 'll be all right now , Mrs. Rogers . Just a nasty turn . "
10994	11001	10967	10968	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Did I faint , sir ? "
11002	11005	10967	10968	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Yes . "
11006	11017	10967	10968	Dr. Armstrong	81	" It was The Voice that awful voice like a judgement "
11033	11039	11028	11029	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Where 's that brandy ? "
11067	11074	11058	11058	he	310	" Drink this , Mrs. Rogers . "
11100	11114	11097	11097	She	90	" I 'm all right now . It just gave me a turn . "
11119	11150	11115	11115	Rogers	90	" Of course it did . It gave me a turn too . Fair made me drop that tray . Wicked lies , it was ! I 'd like to know "
11192	11207	11189	11189	he	53	" Who put that record on the gramophone ? Was it you , Rogers ? "
11211	11243	11208	11208	Rogers	90	" I did n't know what it was . Before God , I did n't know what it was , sir . If I had I 'd never have done it . "
11249	11265	11244	11245	The judge	375	" That is probably true . But I think you 'd better explain , Rogers . "
11279	11292	11275	11275	He	493	" I was just obeying orders , sir , that 's all . "
11293	11297	11244	11245	The judge	375	" Whose orders ? "
11298	11303	11275	11275	He	493	" Mr. Owen 's . "
11309	11325	11304	11306	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Let me get this quite clear . Mr. Owen 's orders were what exactly ? "
11329	11363	11326	11326	Rogers	90	" I was to put a record on the gramophone . I 'd find the record in the drawer and my wife was to start the gramophone when I 'd gone into the drawingroom with
11368	11368	11326	11326	Rogers	90	"
11373	11378	11369	11370	The judge	375	" Avery remarkable story . "
11382	11426	11379	11379	Rogers	90	" It 's the truth , sir . I swear to God it 's the truth . I did n't know what it was not for moment . It had a name on it I thought it was just a piece of music . "
11432	11440	11427	11427	Wargrave	53	" Was there a title on it ? "
11457	11469	11454	11454	He	69	" Quite right , sir . It was entitled Swan Song ... "
11480	11507	11477	11477	He	69	" The whole thing is preposterous preposterous ! Slinging accusations about like this ! Something must be done about it . This fellow Owen whoever he is "
11516	11526	11512	11512	She	74	" That 's just it , who is he ? "
11549	11582	11546	11546	He	375	" That is exactly what we must go into very carefully . I should suggest that you get your wife to bed first of all , Rogers . Then come back here . "
11583	11588	11589	11590	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Yes , sir . "
11593	11603	11589	11590	Dr. Armstrong	81	" I 'll give you a hand , Rogers . "
11626	11643	11622	11623	Tony Marston	86	" Do n't know about you , sir , but I could do with a drink . "
11647	11651	11644	11644	Lombard	69	" I agree . "
11655	11662	11652	11652	Tony	86	" I 'll go and forage . "
11678	11693	11670	11670	He	86	" Found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought in . "
11750	11756	11757	11757	he	81	" She 's all right , "
11760	11783	11757	11757	he	81	" I 've given her a sedative to take . What 's that , a drink ? I could do with one . "
11824	11845	11846	11846	Rogers	90	" Now then , Rogers , we must get to the bottom of this . Who is this Mr. Owen ? "
11849	11857	11846	11846	Rogers	90	" He owns this place , sir . "
11858	11882	11846	11846	Rogers	90	" I am aware of that fact . What I want you to tell me is what you yourself know about the man . "
11888	11905	11846	11846	Rogers	90	" I ca n't say , sir . You see , I 've never seen him . "
11919	11930	11915	11916	General Macarthur	126	" You 've never seen him ? What d'yer mean ? "
11931	11964	11846	11846	Rogers	90	" We 've only been here just under a week , sir , my wife and I. We were engaged by letter , through an agency . The Regina Agency in Plymouth . "
11968	11973	11974	11974	he	89	" Old established firm , "
11980	11987	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" Have you got that letter ? "
11988	12004	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" The letter engaging us ? No , sir . I did n't keep it . "
12005	12023	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" Go on with your story . You were engaged , as you say , by letter . "
12024	12060	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" Yes , sir . We were to arrive on a certain day . We did . Everything was in order here . Plenty of food in stock and everything very nice . Just needed dusting and
12063	12063	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	"
12064	12068	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" What next ? "
12069	12098	11977	11977	Wargrave	53	" Nothing , sir . We got orders by letter again to prepare the rooms for a houseparty and then yesterday by the afternoon post I got another letter from
12133	12133	12102	12102	It	658	"
12139	12147	12134	12135	The judge	375	" Surely you 've got that letter ? "
12148	12159	12160	12160	He	375	" Yes , sir , I 've got it here . "
12172	12175	12176	12176	he	375	" H'm , "
12179	12186	12176	12176	he	375	" Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten . "
12199	12210	12196	12196	He	89	" If you 'll just let me have a look . "
12231	12263	12228	12228	He	89	" Coronation machine . Quite new no defects . Ensign paper the most widely used make . You wo n't get anything out of that . Might be fingerprints , but I doubt
12266	12266	12228	12228	He	89	"
12289	12308	12286	12286	He	116	" Got some fancy Christian names , has n't he ? Ulick Norman Owen . Quite a mouthful . "
12309	12318	12286	12286	He	116	" The old judge said with a slight start :
12319	12341	12342	12342	He	89	" I am obliged to you , Mr. Marston . You have drawn my attention to a curious and suggestive point . "
12361	12402	12403	12403	He	89	" I think the time has come for us all to pool our information . It would be well , I think , for everybody to come forward with all the information they have regarding the owner of this house . "
12410	12437	12403	12403	He	89	" We are all his guests . I think it would be profitable if each one of us were to explain exactly how that came about . "
12452	12462	12463	12463	she	74	" There 's something very peculiar about all this , "
12466	12488	12463	12463	she	74	" I received a letter with a signature that was not very easy to read . It purported to be from a woman
12551	12551	12549	12549	Owen	64	"
12557	12566	12552	12554	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" You have that letter , Miss Brent ? "
12567	12577	12578	12578	She	74	" Yes , I will fetch it for you . "
12598	12607	12595	12595	He	375	" I begin to understand ... Miss Claythorne ? "
12621	12624	12617	12618	The judge	375	" Marston ? "
12628	12646	12625	12625	Anthony	116	" Got a wire . From a pal of mine . Badger Berkeley . Surprised me at the time
12667	12667	12716	12717	The judge	375	"
12675	12679	12672	12672	He	0	" Dr. Armstrong ? "
12680	12687	12672	12672	He	0	" I was called in professionally . "
12688	12701	12672	12672	He	0	" I see . You had no previous acquaintanceship with the family ? "
12702	12715	12672	12672	He	0	" No . A colleague of mine was mentioned in the letter . "
12720	12742	12716	12717	The judge	375	" To give verisimilitude ... Yes , and that colleague , I presume , was momentarily out of touch with you ? "
12743	12748	12716	12717	The judge	375	" Well er yes . "
12761	12771	12749	12749	Lombard	69	" Look here , I 've just thought of something "
12778	12782	12672	12672	He	0	" In a minute "
12783	12786	12716	12717	The judge	375	" But I "
12787	12818	12672	12672	He	0	" We will take one thing at a time , Mr. Lombard . We are at present inquiring into the causes which have resulted in our being assembled here tonight . General
12821	12821	12672	12672	He	0	"
12831	12864	12827	12828	the General	669	" Got a letter from this fellow Owen mentioned some old pals of mine who were to be here hoped I 'd excuse informal invitation . Have n't kept the letter . I 'm
12867	12867	12868	12868	Wargrave	53	"
12871	12875	12868	12868	Wargrave	53	" Mr. Lombard ? "
12901	12907	12908	12908	he	94	" Same sort of thing , "
12911	12932	12908	12908	he	94	" Invitation , mention of mutual friends I fell for it all right . I 've torn up the letter . "
12959	13012	12956	12956	He	53	" Just now we had a somewhat disturbing experience . An apparently disembodied voice spoke to us all by name , uttering certain precise accusations against us . We will deal with those accusations presently . At the moment I am interested in a minor point Amongst the names recited was that of William
13050	13054	13041	13041	you	672	" Blore said sulkily :
13055	13079	13041	13041	you	672	" Cat 's out of the bag , it seems . I suppose I 'd better admit that my name is n't Davis . "
13080	13087	13041	13041	you	672	" You are William Henry Blore ? "
13088	13093	13041	13041	you	672	" That 's right . "
13094	13100	13102	13102	Lombard	94	" I will add something , "
13104	13132	13102	13102	Lombard	94	" Not only are you here under a false name , Mr. Blore , but in addition I 've noticed this evening that you 're a firstclass liar .
13169	13169	13157	13157	you	672	"
13195	13202	13203	13203	he	116	" Now then , you swine , "
13206	13210	13203	13203	he	116	" Any explanation ? "
13222	13230	13231	13231	he	89	" You gentlemen have got me wrong , "
13234	13261	13231	13231	he	89	" I 've got my credentials and you can see them . I 'm an exC.I.D. man . I run a detective agency in Plymouth . I was

13273	13277	13268	13270	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" By whom ? "
13278	13327	13231	13231	he	89	" This man Owen . Enclosed a handsome money order for expenses and instructed me as to what he wanted done . I was to join the house party , posing as a guest . I was given all your names . I was to watch you all . "
13328	13333	13268	13270	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Any reason given ? "
13338	13359	13334	13334	Blore	89	" Mrs. Owen 's jewels . Mrs. Owen my foot ! I do n't believe there 's any such person . "
13374	13384	13385	13385	he	89	" Your conclusions are , I think , justified , "
13388	13423	13385	13385	he	89	" Ulick Norman Owen ! In Miss Brent 's letter , though the signature of the surname is a mere scrawl the Christian names are reasonably clear Una Nancy in either case , you notice ,
13455	13455	13472	13472	He	375	"
13459	13466	13456	13456	Vera	129	" But this is fantastic mad ! "
13475	13503	13472	13472	He	375	" Oh , yes . I 've no doubt in my own mind that we have been invited here by a madman probably a dangerous homicidal lunatic . "
13533	13561	13562	13562	He	375	" We will now proceed to the next stage of our inquiry . First , however , I will just add my own credentials to the list . "
13576	13612	13616	13616	she	676	" This purports to be from an old friend of mine , Lady Constance Culmington . I hove not seen her for some years . She went to the East . It is exactly the kind of
13778	13778	13768	13768	He	681	"
13786	13812	13783	13783	he	681	" He knows , you see , a good deal . And out of his knowledge concerning us , he has made certain definite accusations . "
13823	13831	13819	13820	General Macarthur	126	" Apack of damn lies ! Slander ! "
13836	13841	13842	13842	Her	129	" It 's iniquitous ! "
13847	13850	13842	13842	Her	129	" Wicked ! "
13855	13869	13851	13851	Rogers	90	" A lie a wicked lie ... we never did neither of us ... "
13874	13886	13870	13871	Anthony Marston	116	" Do n't know what the damned fool was getting at ! "
13907	13942	13898	13898	He	53	" I wish to say this . Our unknown friend accuses me of the murder of one Edward Seton . I remember Seton perfectly well . He came up before me for trial in June of
14068	14068	14059	14059	I	0	"
14112	14119	14107	14107	Matthews	132	" Not a doubt of the verdict .
14124	14132	14092	14092	K.C.	692	" And then afterwards he had heard comments :
14133	14163	14092	14092	K.C.	692	" Judge was dead against him . Turned the jury right round and they brought him in guilty . Quite legal , though . Old Wargrave knows his law . "
14164	14179	14092	14092	K.C.	692	" It was almost as though he had a private down on the fellow . "
14204	14219	14199	14199	he	310	" Did you know Seton at all ? I mean previous to the case . "
14236	14247	14232	14233	the judge	375	" I knew nothing of Seton previous to the case . "
14253	14264	14248	14248	Armstrong	81	" The fellow 's lying I know he 's lying . "
14277	14351	14274	14274	She	129	" I 'd like to tell you . About that child Cyril Hamilton . I was nursery governess to him . He was forbidden to swim out far . One day , when my attention was distracted , he started off . I swam after him ... I could n't get there in time ... It was awful ... But it was n't my fault . At the inquest the Coroner exonerated me . And
14384	14384	14361	14361	she	697	"
14401	14443	14398	14398	He	126	" There , there , my dear . Of course it 's not true . Fellow 's a madman . A madman ! Got a bee in his bonnet ! Got hold of the wrong end of the stick all round . "
14456	14473	14452	14452	He	126	" Best really to leave this sort of thing unanswered . However , feel I ought to say
14537	14537	14532	14535	Absolutely Caesar 's wife	703	"
14573	14577	14570	14570	He	94	" About those natives "
14581	14586	14578	14578	Marston	116	" What about them ? "
14591	14628	14587	14588	Philip Lombard	69	" Story 's quite true ! I left 'em ! Matter of selfpreservation . We were lost in the bush . I and a couple of other fellows took what food there was and cleared out . "
14634	14644	14629	14630	General Macarthur	126	" You abandoned your men left them to starve ? "
14648	14687	14645	14645	Lombard	94	" Not quite the act of a pukka sahib , I 'm afraid . But selfpreservation 's a man 's first duty . And natives do n't mind dying , you know . They do n't feel about it as
14691	14691	14688	14688	Europeans	135	"
14707	14714	14700	14700	She	129	" You left them to die ? "
14718	14725	14715	14715	Lombard	94	" I left them to die . "
14744	14772	14735	14736	Anthony Marston	116	" I 've just been thinking John and Lucy Combes . Must have been a couple of kids I ran over near Cambridge . Beastly bad luck . "
14779	14787	14773	14775	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Lor them , or for you ? "
14791	14830	14788	14788	Anthony	116	" Well , I was thinking for me but of course , you 're right , sir , it was damned bad luck on them . Of course it was a pure accident . They rushed out of some cottage

14852	14872	14847	14848	Dr. Armstrong	81	" This speeding 's all wrong all wrong ! Young men like you are a danger to the community . "
14881	14900	14878	14878	He	116	" Speed 's come to stay . English roads are hopeless , of course . Ca n't get up a

14943	14958	14937	14937	He	116	" Well , anyway , it was n't my fault . Just an accident ! "
14984	14995	14975	14975	He	705	" If I might just say a word , sir . "
14999	15005	14996	14996	Lombard	94	" Go ahead , Rogers . "
15021	15064	15012	15012	his	705	" There was a mention , sir , of me and Mrs. Rogers . And of Miss Brady . There is n't a word of truth in it , sir . My wife and I were with Miss Brady till she died . She

15208	15213	15200	15200	He	94	" Oh , yea ? "
15227	15241	15224	15224	He	89	" Came into a little something at her death , though ? Eh ? "
15251	15275	15247	15247	He	94	" Miss Brady left us a legacy in recognition of our faithful services . And why not , I 'd like to know ? "
15279	15287	15276	15276	Lombard	94	" What about yourself , Mr. Blore ? "
15288	15293	15247	15247	He	94	" What about me ? "
15294	15303	15276	15276	Lombard	94	" Your name was included in the list . "
15308	15323	15247	15247	He	94	" Landor , you mean ? That was the bank robbery London and Commercial . "
15332	15367	15368	15368	Blore	89	" I remember . It did n't come before me , but I remember the case . Landor was convicted on your evidence . You were the police officer in charge of the case ? "
15371	15375	15368	15368	Blore	89	" I was . "
15376	15397	15247	15247	He	94	" Landor got penal servitude for life and died in Dartmoor a year later . He was a delicate man . "
15401	15425	15398	15398	Blore	89	" He was a crook . It was he who knocked out the night watchman . The case was quite clear against him . "
15430	15446	15426	15426	Wargrave	53	" You were complimented , I think , on your able handling of the case . "
15451	15457	15447	15447	Blore	89	" I got my promotion . "
15465	15473	15458	15458	He	89	" I was only doing my duty . "
15484	15514	15481	15481	He	94	" What a dutyloving , lawabiding lot we all seem to be ! Myself excepted . What about you , doctor and your little professional mistake ? Illegal operation , was
15517	15517	15481	15481	He	94	"
15547	15558	15559	15559	he	81	" I 'm at a loss to understand the matter , "
15562	15587	15559	15559	he	81	" The name meant nothing to me when it was spoken . What was it Clees ? Close ? I really ca n't remember having a
15662	15662	15652	15652	they	718	"
15673	15709	15670	15670	He	81	" Drunk that 's what it was drunk ... And I operated ! Nerves all to pieces hands shaking . I killed her , all right . Poor devil elderly woman simple job if I 'd been
15758	15758	15729	15729	she	724	"
15805	15821	15802	15802	She	74	" Are you waiting for me to say something ? I have nothing to say . "
15826	15832	15822	15823	The judge	375	" Nothing , Miss Brent ? "
15833	15836	15822	15823	The judge	375	" Nothing . "
15852	15858	15848	15848	He	375	" You reserve your defence ? "
15864	15879	15859	15860	Miss Brent	74	" There is no question of defence . I have always acted in accordance with the
15894	15894	15885	15885	I	0	"
15934	15959	15931	15931	he	375	" Our inquiry rests there . Now , Rogers , who else is there on this island besides ourselves and you and your wife ? "
15960	15969	15924	15924	his	375	" Nobody , sir . Nobody at all . "
15970	15977	15931	15931	he	375	" You 're sure of that ? "
15978	15984	15924	15924	his	375	" Quite sure , sir . "
15988	16031	15985	15985	Wargrave	53	" I am not yet clear as to the purpose of our Unknown host in getting us to assemble here . But in my opinion this person , whoever he may be , is not sane in the accepted sense of the word .
16032	16063	15924	15924	his	375	" He may be dangerous . In my opinion it would be well for us to leave this place as soon as possible . I suggest that we leave tonight . "
16067	16084	16064	16064	Rogers	90	" I beg your pardon , sir , but there 's no boat on the island . "
16085	16091	15985	15985	Wargrave	53	" No boat at all ? "
16092	16097	16064	16064	Rogers	90	" No , sir . "
16098	16107	15985	15985	Wargrave	53	" How do you communicate with the mainland ? "
16108	16136	16064	16064	Rogers	90	" Fred Narracott , he comes over every morning , sir . He brings the bread and the milk and the post , and takes the orders . "
16142	16165	16137	16139	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Then in my opinion it would be well if we all left tomorrow morning as soon as Narracott 's boat arrives . "
16188	16195	16196	16196	he	116	" A bit unsporting , what ? "
16199	16221	16196	16196	he	116	" Ought to ferret out the mystery before we go . Whole thing 's like a detective story . Positively thrilling . "
16227	16248	16222	16223	The judge	375	" At my time of life , I have no desire for ' thrills , ' as you call them . "
16255	16273	16249	16249	Anthony	116	" The legal life 's narrowing ! I 'm all for crime ! Here 's to it . "
16385	16393	16377	16377	He	81	" My God ! he 's dead ! "
16491	16504	16487	16488	General Macarthur	126	" Dead : D'you mean the fellow just choked and and died ? "
16509	16526	16505	16506	The physician	738	" You can call it choking if you like . He died of asphyxiation right enough . "
16564	16579	16560	16561	General Macarthur	126	" Never knew a man could die like that just of a choking fit ! "
16588	16599	16580	16581	Emily Brent	74	" In the midst of life we are in death . "
16609	16635	16605	16605	He	81	" No , a man does n't die of a mere choking fit . Marston 's death was n't what we call a natural death . "
16643	16651	16636	16636	Vera	129	" Was there something in the whiskey ? "
16655	16688	16652	16652	Armstrong	81	" Yes . Ca n't say exactly . Everything points to one of the cyanides . No distinctive smell of Prussic Acid , probably Potassium Cyanide . It acts pretty well instantaneously . "
16694	16701	16689	16690	The judge	375	" It was in his glass ? "
16702	16705	16706	16707	The doctor	310	" Yes . "
16742	16749	16737	16737	He	310	" They 're both all right . "
16753	16767	16750	16750	Lombard	94	" You mean he must have put the stuff in his glass himself ! "
16779	16784	16776	16776	He	81	" Seems like it . "
16788	16799	16785	16785	Blore	89	" Suicide , eh ? That 's a queer go . "
16804	16848	16800	16800	Vera	129	" You 'd never think that he would kill himself . He was so alive . He was oh enjoying himself ! When he came down the hill in his car this evening he looked he looked oh , I ca n't explain ! "
16894	16903	16890	16891	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Is there any possibility other than suicide ? "
16969	16997	16965	16965	Blore	89	" You know , doctor , it does n't seem right to me . I should n't have said Mr. Marston was a suicidal type of gentleman . "
17001	17005	16998	16998	Armstrong	81	" I agree . "
17076	17088	17072	17073	Emily Brent	74	" We 'd better go to bed . It 's late . "
17124	17133	17120	17121	The judge	375	" Yes , we must get some sleep . "
17137	17147	17134	17134	Rogers	90	" I have n't cleared yet in the diningroom . "
17152	17159	17148	17148	Lombard	94	" Do it in the morning . "
17165	17172	17160	17160	Armstrong	81	" Is your wife all right ? "
17173	17182	17183	17183	He	81	" I 'll go and see , sir . "
17191	17198	17183	17183	He	81	" Sleeping beautiful , she is . "
17199	17202	17204	17205	the doctor	310	" Good , "
17207	17213	17204	17205	the doctor	310	" Do n't disturb her . "
17214	17244	17245	17245	He	81	" No , sir . I 'll just put things straight in the diningroom and make sure everything ' locked up right , and then I 'll turn in . "
17749	17766	17744	17744	He	776	" That 's a rum go ! I could have sworn there were ten of them . "
17837	17840	17830	17830	her	144	" Dull ! "
18118	18123	18116	18116	his	115	" Yes , sir . "
18311	18332	18306	18306	People	1895	" Old Macarthur lost his nerve a bit , made some colossal blunders , sacrificed some of his best men . "
18882	18892	18879	18879	He	145	" I wonder when we shall get away again . "
18978	18985	18975	18975	He	145	" Peaceful sound . Peaceful place ... "
18989	19015	18986	18986	He	145	" Best of an island is once you get there you ca n't go any further ... you 've come to the end of things ... "
19065	19086	19061	19061	She	129	" Hugo ... Hugo ... Why do I feel you 're so near to me tonight ? ... Somewhere quite close ...
19087	19114	19061	19061	She	129	" Where is he really ? I do n't know . I never shall know . He just went away right away out of my life ! "
19171	19194	19152	19153	Mrs. Hamilton	65	" I want to swim out to the rock . Miss Claythorne . Why ca n't I swim out to the rock ? "
19212	19222	19249	19249	Hugo	66	" Come out for a stroll , Miss Claythorne . "
19223	19230	19249	19249	Hugo	66	" I think perhaps I will . "
19255	19272	19249	19249	Hugo	66	" I love you , I love you . You know I love you , Vera ? "
19285	19353	19249	19249	Hugo	66	" I ca n't ask you to marry me . I 've not got a penny . Its all I can do to keep myself . Queer , you know , once , for three months I had the chance of being a rich man to look forward to . Cyril was n't born until three months after Maurice died . If he 'd been a girl ... "
19377	19418	19420	19420	he	828	" I had n't built on it , of course . But it was a bit of a knock . Oh , well , luck 's luck ! Cyril 's a nice kid . I 'm awfully fond of him . "
19476	19489	19538	19538	She	129	" Miss Claythorne , why ca n't I swim to the rock ? "
19494	19502	19538	19538	She	129	" It s too far , Cyril . "
19503	19509	19563	19563	She	129	" But , Miss Claythorne ... "
19527	19537	19524	19524	She	129	" I wish I had some proper sleeping stuff . "
19541	19562	19538	19538	She	129	" If I were doing away with myself I 'd take an overdose of veronal something like that not cyanide ! "
19614	19624	19609	19609	She	129	" It 's horrible just like us this evening ... "
19875	19886	19872	19872	she	74	" In the midst of life we are in death ... "
20063	20067	20054	20054	Rogers	90	" Doctor doctor ! "
20084	20089	20080	20080	He	81	" What is it ? "
20090	20117	20080	20080	He	81	" It 's the wife , doctor . I ca n't get her to wake . My God ! I ca n't get her to wake . And
20127	20127	20119	20119	she	90	"
20188	20194	20185	20185	Rogers	90	" Is she is she ? "
20206	20213	20203	20203	Armstrong	81	" Yes , she 's gone . "
20248	20260	20245	20245	Rogers	90	" Was it was it ' er ' eart , doctor ? "
20275	20283	20272	20272	he	81	" What was her health like normally ? "
20287	20294	20284	20284	Rogers	90	" She was a bit rheumaticky . "
20295	20303	20272	20272	he	81	" Any doctor been attending her recently ? "
20304	20307	20308	20308	Rogers	90	" Doctor ? "
20311	20323	20308	20308	Rogers	90	" Not been to a doctor for years neither of us . "
20324	20337	20272	20272	he	81	" You 'd no reason to believe she suffered from heart trouble ? "
20338	20349	20308	20308	Rogers	90	" No , doctor . I never knew of anything . "
20353	20359	20350	20350	Armstrong	81	" Did she sleep well ? "
20382	20391	20379	20379	He	81	" She did n't sleep extra well no . "
20397	20407	20392	20393	The doctor	310	" Did she take things to make her sleep ? "
20415	20437	20438	20438	Armstrong	81	" Take things ? To make her sleep ? Not that I knew of . I 'm sure she did n't . "
20515	20532	20512	20512	Rogers	90	" She did n't have nothing last night , sir , except what you gave her ... "
20608	20624	20605	20605	He	89	" No sign of that motor boat yet . I 've been watching for it . "
20630	20642	20625	20625	Vera	129	" Devon 's a sleepy county . Things are usually late . "
20659	20667	20655	20655	He	69	" What d'you think of the weather ? "
20677	20684	20674	20674	Blore	89	" Looks all right to me . "
20697	20710	20694	20694	He	69	" It will come on to blow before the day 's out . "
20714	20718	20711	20711	Blore	89	" Squally eh ? "
20733	20744	20729	20730	Philip Lombard	69	" Breakfast ? Well , I could do with some . "
20761	20787	20752	20752	Blore	89	" You know , it beats me why that young fellow wanted to do himself in ! I 've been worrying about it all night . "
20802	20808	20799	20799	He	69	" Got any alternative theory ? "
20809	20829	20830	20831	Emily Brent	74	" I 'd want some proof . Motive , to begin with . Welloff I should say he was . "
20846	20852	20842	20842	She	74	" Is the boat coming ? "
20853	20857	20859	20859	Vera	129	" Not yet , "
20906	20914	20902	20903	Emily Brent	74	" That man looks ill this morning . "
20932	20962	20929	20929	He	81	" You must excuse any er shortcomings this morning . Rogers has had to do the best he can for breakfast singlehanded . Mrs. Rogers has er not been able to
20968	20968	20929	20929	He	81	"
20974	20983	20969	20970	Emily Brent	74	" What 's the matter with the woman ? "
20989	21016	20984	20985	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Let us start our breakfast . The eggs will be cold . Afterwards , there are several matters I want to discuss with you all . "
21106	21136	21103	21103	He	81	" I thought it better to wait until you had had your breakfast before telling you of a sad piece of news . Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep . "
21147	21160	21144	21144	Vera	129	" How awful ! Two deaths on this island since we arrived ! "
21177	21188	21165	21165	his	53	" H'm very remarkable what was the cause of death ? "
21194	21200	21171	21171	his	53	" Impossible to say offhand . "
21201	21208	21171	21171	his	53	" There must be an autopsy ? "
21209	21231	21171	21171	his	53	" I certainly could n't give a certificate . I have no knowledge whatsoever of the woman 's state of health . "
21235	21261	21232	21232	Vera	129	" She was a very nervouslooking creature . And she had a shock last night . It might have been heart failure , I suppose ? "
21267	21284	21262	21263	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Her heart certainly failed to beat but what caused it to fail is the question . "
21302	21305	21306	21306	she	74	" Conscience ! "
21314	21326	21309	21309	Armstrong	81	" What exactly do you mean by that , Miss Brent ? "
21338	21363	21327	21328	Emily Brent	74	" You all heard . She was accused , together with her husband , of having deliberately murdered her former employer an old lady . "
21364	21369	21370	21371	Emily Brent	74	" And you think ? "
21374	21404	21370	21371	Emily Brent	74	" I think that that accusation was true . You all saw her last night . She broke down completely and fainted . The shock of having her wickedness brought home
21419	21419	21413	21413	She	74	"
21427	21434	21435	21435	he	81	" It is a possible theory , "
21438	21459	21435	21435	he	81	" One can not adopt it without more exact knowledge of her state of health . If there was cardiac weakness "
21465	21478	21460	21461	Emily Brent	74	" Call it , if you prefer , an Act of God . "
21489	21501	21484	21485	Mr. Blore	89	" That 's carrying things a bit far , Miss Brent . "
21518	21541	21515	21515	She	74	" You regard it as impossible that a sinner should be struck down by the wrath of God ! I do not ! "
21556	21584	21548	21548	He	375	" My dear lady , in my experience of illdoing , Providence leaves the work of conviction and chastisement to us mortals and the process is often fraught with
21593	21593	21594	21595	Emily Brent	74	"
21604	21622	21623	21623	Armstrong	81	" What did she have to eat and drink last night after she went up to bed ? "
21626	21629	21623	21623	Armstrong	81	" Nothing . "
21630	21663	21623	21623	Armstrong	81	" She did n't take anything ? A cup of tea ? A drink of water ? I 'll bet you she had a cup of tea . That sort always does . "
21664	21673	21623	21623	Armstrong	81	" Rogers assures me she had nothing whatsoever . "
21674	21677	21679	21679	Blore	89	" Ah , "
21681	21688	21679	21679	Blore	89	" But he might say so ! "
21706	21713	21702	21703	Philip Lombard	69	" So that 's your idea ? "
21718	21735	21714	21714	Blore	89	" Well , why not ? We all heard that accusation last night . May be sheer moonshine
21786	21786	21794	21794	she	129	"
21797	21810	21794	21794	she	129	" No , I do n't think Mrs. Rogers ever felt safe . "
21819	21825	21826	21826	his	89	" Just like a woman , "
21833	21853	21830	21830	He	89	" That 's as may be . Anyway there 's no active danger to them as far as they know .
21921	21940	21917	21917	she	500	" And there 's the position for you ! They 've done a murder and got away with it .
22056	22056	22038	22038	he	783	"
22061	22080	22057	22057	Armstrong	81	" There was no empty cup by her bedside there was nothing there at all . I looked . "
22084	22117	22081	22081	Blore	89	" Of course there would n't be ! First thing he 'd do when she 'd drunk it would be to take that cup and saucer away and wash it up carefully . "
22129	22152	22124	22125	General Macarthur	78	" It may be so . But I should hardly think it possible that a man would do that to his wife . "
22162	22183	22159	22159	He	89	" When a man 's neck 's in danger , he does n't stop to think too much about sentiment . "
22213	22250	22203	22203	He	783	" Is there anything more I can get you ? I 'm sorry there was so little toast , but we 've run right out of bread . The new bread has n't come over from the mainland
22253	22253	22203	22203	He	783	"
22267	22278	22264	22264	He	53	" What time does the motor boat usually come over ? "
22279	22317	22318	22319	Philip Lombard	69	" Between seven and eight , sir . Sometimes it 's a bit after eight . Do n't know what Fred Narracott can be doing this morning . If he 's ill he 'd send his brother . "
22322	22329	22318	22319	Philip Lombard	69	" What 's the time now ? "
22330	22338	22318	22319	Philip Lombard	69	" Ten minutes to ten , sir . "
22364	22381	22318	22319	Philip Lombard	69	" Sorry to hear about your wife , Rogers . Doctor 's just been telling us . "
22387	22397	22384	22384	his	69	" Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . "
22423	22428	22419	22420	Philip Lombard	69	" About this motor boat "
22442	22460	22439	22439	He	89	" I know what you 're thinking , Mr. Lombard . I 've asked myself the same question .
22481	22481	22474	22474	It	419	"
22482	22487	22489	22489	Lombard	94	" Found the answer ? "
22491	22520	22521	22522	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's not an accident that 's what I say . It 's part and parcel of the whole business . It 's all bound up together . "
22525	22534	22521	22522	Philip Lombard	69	" It wo n't come , you think ? "
22545	22553	22554	22554	he	94	" The motor boat 's not coming , "
22570	22578	22557	22557	Blore	89	" You think not too , General ? "
22584	22621	22579	22580	General Macarthur	78	" Of course it wo n't come . We 're counting on the motor boat to take us off the island . That 's the meaning of the whole business . We 're not going to leave the
22643	22643	22636	22636	you	888	"
22656	22679	22648	22648	he	78	" That 's peace real peace . To come to the end not to have to go on ... Yes , peace ... "
22732	22755	22729	22729	Blore	89	" There goes another one who 's balmy ! Looks as though it 'll end with the whole lot going that way . "
22760	22770	22756	22757	Philip Lombard	69	" I do n't fancy you will , Blore . "
22775	22788	22789	22789	He	69	" It would take a lot to send me off my head . "
22793	22810	22789	22789	He	69	" And I do n't think you 'll be going that way either , Mr. Lombard . "
22815	22827	22811	22812	Philip Lombard	69	" I feel quite sane at the minute , thank you . "
22892	22905	22884	22884	Rogers	90	" Could I have a word with you , sir , please ? "
22953	22971	23012	23012	He	155	" Please , sir , if I could have a word with you . Inside , sir . "
22988	23000	22985	22985	He	155	" What 's the matter , man ? Pull yourself together . "
23001	23011	23012	23012	He	155	" In here , sir , come in here . "
23033	23036	23038	23038	Armstrong	155	" Well , "
23040	23045	23038	23038	Armstrong	155	" what is it ? "
23062	23077	23059	23059	He	155	" There 's things going on , sir , that I do n't understand . "
23082	23088	23078	23078	Armstrong	155	" Things ? What things ? "
23089	23132	23059	23059	He	155	" You 'll think I 'm crazy , sir . You 'll say it is n't anything . But it 's got to be explained , sir . It 's got to be explained . Because it does n't make any sense . "
23133	23152	23078	23078	Armstrong	155	" Well , man , tell me what it is ? Do n't go on talking in riddles . "
23160	23198	23157	23157	He	155	" It 's those little figures , sir . In the middle of the table . The little china figures . Ten of them , there were . I 'll swear to that , ten of them . "
23202	23215	23199	23199	Armstrong	155	" Yes , ten . We counted them last night at dinner . "
23220	23244	23216	23216	Rogers	90	" That 's just it , sir . Last night , when I was clearing up , there was n't but nine , sir .
23285	23307	23278	23278	I	0	" But now , sir , when I came to clear away . See for yourself if you do n't believe me .
23308	23331	23257	23257	I	0	" There 's only eight , sir ! Only eight ! It does n't make sense , does it ? Only eight ... "
23423	23452	23419	23420	Emily Brent	74	" The man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of person . It is really very odd that he should be so late this morning . "
23474	23493	23468	23468	She	129	" You must keep cool . This is n't like you . You 've always had excellent nerves . "
23503	23516	23495	23495	she	129	" I wish he would come . 11 want to get away . "
23522	23531	23517	23518	Emily Brent	74	" I 've no doubt we all do . "
23535	23551	23532	23532	Vera	129	" It 's all so extraordinary ... There seems no no meaning in it all . "
23560	23577	23552	23556	The elderly woman beside her	913	" I 'm very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in . Really that letter is
23598	23598	23587	23587	I	0	"
23603	23608	23599	23599	Vera	129	" I suppose not . "
23609	23618	23620	23621	Emily Brent	74	" One takes things for granted too much , "
23633	23644	23630	23630	She	129	" Do you really think what you said at breakfast ? "
23645	23663	23698	23698	she	74	" Be a little more precise , my dear . To what in particular are you referring ? "
23671	23688	23689	23690	Emily Brent	74	" Do you really think that Rogers and his wife did away with that old lady ? "
23701	23716	23698	23698	she	74	" Personally , I am quite sure of it . What do you think ? "
23717	23726	23698	23698	she	74	" I do n't know what to think . "
23731	23747	23727	23728	Emily Brent	74	" Everything goes to support the idea . The way the woman fainted . And the man
23779	23779	23772	23772	I	0	"
23783	23813	23780	23780	Vera	129	" The way she looked scared of her own shadow ! I 've never seen a woman look so frightened ... She must have been always haunted by it ... "
23818	23861	23814	23815	Miss Brent	74	" I remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' It 's very true , that . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' "
23871	23881	23868	23868	She	129	" But , Miss Brent Miss Brent in that case "
23882	23888	23868	23868	She	129	" Yes , my dear ? "
23889	23898	23868	23868	She	129	" The others ? What about the others ? "
23899	23907	23868	23868	She	129	" I do n't quite understand you . "
23908	23927	23928	23928	She	129	" All the other accusations they they were n't true ? But if it 's true about the Rogerses "
23955	23982	23952	23952	She	74	" Ah , I understand you now . Well , there is that Mr. Lombard . He admits to having abandoned twenty men to their deaths . "
23986	23992	23983	23983	Vera	129	" They were only natives ... "
23998	24008	23993	23994	Emily Brent	74	" Black or white , they are our brothers . "
24012	24031	24009	24009	Vera	129	" Our black brothers our black brothers . Oh , I 'm going to laugh . I 'm hysterical .
24037	24037	24038	24039	Emily Brent	74	"
24043	24057	24038	24039	Emily Brent	74	" Of course , some of the other accusations were very farfetched and ridiculous .
24088	24088	24089	24089	She	74	"
24096	24124	24089	24089	She	74	" Naturally , considering the circumstances , I was not going to say anything last night . It was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemen . "
24125	24128	24089	24089	She	74	" No ? "
24139	24175	24134	24135	Miss Brent	74	" Beatrice Taylor was in service with me . Not a nice girl as I found out too late . I was very much deceived in her . She had nice manners and was very clean and
24224	24236	24210	24210	I	0	" She paused , her delicate nose wrinkling itself in distaste . "
24273	24273	24266	24266	they	922	"
24282	24286	24274	24274	Vera	129	" What happened ? "
24287	24310	24274	24274	Vera	129	" Naturally I did not keep her an hour under my roof . No one shall ever say that I condoned immorality . "
24318	24324	24311	24311	Vera	129	" What happened to her ? "
24329	24356	24325	24326	Miss Brent	74	" The abandoned creature , not content with having one sin on her conscience , committed a still graver sin . She took her own life . "
24362	24367	24357	24357	Vera	129	" She killed herself ? "
24368	24378	24357	24357	Vera	129	" Yes , she threw herself into the river . "
24396	24421	24393	24393	She	129	" What did you feel like when you knew she 'd done that ? Were n't you sorry ? Did n't you blame yourself ? "
24428	24440	24425	24425	herself	74	" I ? I had nothing with which to reproach myself . "
24444	24453	24441	24441	Vera	129	" But if your hardness drove her to it "
24459	24491	24454	24455	Emily Brent	74	" Her own action her own sin that was what drove her to it . If she had behaved like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happened . "
24675	24687	24669	24669	He	81	" Lombard , can I speak to you for a minute ? "
24691	24695	24688	24688	Philip	69	" Of course . "
24722	24728	24719	24719	Armstrong	81	" I want a consultation . "
24738	24749	24735	24735	He	94	" My dear fellow , I 've no medical knowledge . "
24750	24763	24735	24735	He	94	" No , no , I mean as to the general situation . "
24764	24771	24735	24735	He	94	" Oh , that 's different . "
24775	24786	24772	24772	Armstrong	81	" Frankly , what do you think of the position ? "
24796	24806	24793	24793	he	94	" It 's rather suggestive , is n't it ? "
24807	24826	24793	24793	he	94	" What are your ideas on the subject of that woman ? Do you accept Blore 's theory ? "
24837	24845	24834	24834	He	69	" It 's perfectly feasible taken alone . "
24846	24849	24793	24793	he	94	" Exactly . "
24867	24901	24862	24863	The latter	332	" That is , accepting the premise that Mr. and Mrs. Rogers have successfully got away with murder in their time . And I do n't see why they should n't . What do you
24912	24912	24793	24793	he	94	"
24917	24998	24913	24913	Armstrong	81	" It might be simpler than that . I asked Rogers this morning what this Miss Brady had suffered from . His answer was enlightening . I do n't need to go into medical details , but in a certain form of cardiac trouble , amyl nitrite is used . When an attack comes on an ampoule of amyl nitrite is broken and it is inhaled . If amyl nitrite were withheld well , the consequences might easily be fatal . "
25004	25017	24999	25000	Philip Lombard	69	" As simple as that . It must have been rather tempting . "
25022	25051	25018	25019	The doctor	310	" Yes , no positive action . No arsenic to obtain and administer nothing definite just negation ! And Rogers hurried through the night to fetch a doctor and they
25062	25062	25018	25019	The doctor	310	"
25063	25080	25082	25083	Philip Lombard	69	" And , even if any one knew , nothing could ever be proved against them , "
25089	25098	25085	25085	He	69	" Of course that explains a good deal . "
25104	25110	25099	25099	Armstrong	81	" I beg your pardon . "
25114	25156	25111	25111	Lombard	69	" I mean it explains Indian Island . There are crimes that can not be brought home to their perpetrators . Instance , the Rogerses ' . Another instance , old Wargrave , who committed his murder strictly within the law . "
25161	25167	25157	25157	Armstrong	81	" You believe that story ? "
25172	25229	25168	25169	Philip Lombard	69	" Oh , yes , I believe it . Wargrave murdered Edward Seton all right , murdered him as surely as if he 'd stuck a stiletto through him ! But he was clever enough to do it from the judge 's seat in wig and gown . So in the ordinary way you ca n't bring his
25236	25236	25168	25169	Philip Lombard	69	"
25248	25266	25267	25268	Philip Lombard	69	" Murder in Hospital . Murder on the Operating Table . Safe yes , safe as houses ! "
25272	25280	25267	25268	Philip Lombard	69	" Hence Mr. Owen hence Indian Island ! "
25287	25307	25308	25309	Philip Lombard	69	" Now we 're getting down to it . What 's the real purpose of getting us all here ? "
25312	25318	25308	25309	Philip Lombard	69	" What do you think ? "
25323	25371	25319	25319	Armstrong	81	" Let 's go back a minute to this woman 's death . What are the possible theories ? Rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show away . Second possibility : She lost her nerve and took an easy way out herself . "
25376	25381	25372	25373	Philip Lombard	69	" Suicide , eh ? "
25382	25390	25372	25373	Philip Lombard	69	" What do you say to that ? "
25394	25428	25391	25391	Lombard	69	" It could have been yes if it had n't been for Marston 's death . Two suicides within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow ! And if you tell me that
25515	25515	25510	25510	your	949	"
25519	25545	25516	25516	Armstrong	81	" Nobody in their senses carries Potassium Cyanide . It might be done by some one who was going to take a wasps ' nest . "
25546	25562	25597	25597	Armstrong	81	" The ardent gardener or landowner , in fact ? Again , not Anthony Marston . It
25596	25596	25597	25597	Armstrong	81	"
25601	25605	25597	25597	Armstrong	81	" Or else ? "
25610	25636	25606	25607	Philip Lombard	69	" Why make me say it ? When it 's on the tip of your own tongue . Anthony Marston was murdered , of course . "
25645	25650	25637	25639	Ill Dr. Armstrong	81	" And Mrs. Rogers ? "
25655	25674	25651	25651	Lombard	69	" I could believe in Anthony 's suicide ( with difficulty ) if it were n't for Mrs. Rogers .
25735	25735	25736	25736	Armstrong	81	"
25739	25751	25736	25736	Armstrong	81	" I can perhaps give you some help towards that theory . "
25775	25801	25772	25772	Lombard	69	" Yes , litde china Indian figures ... There were certainly ten last night at dinner . And now there are eight , you say ? "
25806	25815	25802	25803	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Ten little Indian boys going out to dine ;
25827	25836	25802	25803	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Nine little Indian boys sat up very late ;
25846	25846	25837	25837	One	292	"
25864	25892	25861	25861	his	69	" Fits too damned well to be a coincidence ! Anthony Marston dies of asphyxiation or choking last night after dinner , and Mother Rogers oversleeps herself with a
25895	25895	25904	25904	Lombard	69	"
25896	25900	25902	25902	Armstrong	81	" And therefore ? "
25909	25927	25904	25904	Lombard	69	" And therefore another kind of puzzle . The Nigger in the Woodpile ! X ! Mr. Owen !
25937	25937	25931	25935	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	960	"
25938	25941	25942	25942	Armstrong	81	" Ah ! "
25949	25973	25942	25942	Armstrong	81	" You agree . But you see what it involves ? Rogers swore that there was no one but ourselves and he and his wife
25978	25978	25942	25942	Armstrong	81	"
25979	25990	25931	25935	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	960	" Rogers is wrong ! Or possibly Rogers is lying ! "
25996	26019	25993	25993	his	81	" I do n't think he 's lying . The man 's scared . He 's scared nearly out of his senses . "
26027	26062	26024	26024	He	69	" No motor boat this morning . That fits in . Mr. Owen 's little arrangements again to the fore . Indian Island is to be isolated until Mr. Owen has finished his job . "
26071	26082	26068	26068	He	81	" You realize the man must be a raving maniac ! "
26097	26108	26094	26094	his	69	" There 's one thing Mr. Owen did n't realize . "
26109	26114	26094	26094	his	69	" What 's that ? "
26115	26145	26094	26094	his	69	" This island 's more or less a bare rock . We shall make short work of searching it . We 'll soon ferret out U.N. Owen , Esq . "
26151	26157	26146	26147	Dr. Armstrong	81	" He 'll be dangerous . "
26162	26185	26158	26159	Philip Lombard	69	" Dangerous ? Who 's afraid of the big bad wolf ? I 'll be dangerous when I get hold of him ! "
26191	26251	26186	26186	He	69	" We 'd better rope in Blore to help us . He 'll be a good man in a pinch . Better not tell the women . As for the others , the General 's ga ga , I think , and old Wargrave 's forte is masterly inactivity . The three of us can attend to this job . "
26268	26307	26260	26260	He	89	" What you 've said about those china figures , sir , makes all the difference . That 's crazy , that is ! There 's only one thing . You do n't think this Owen 's idea might be
26319	26319	26260	26260	He	89	"
26320	26326	26260	26260	He	89	" Explain yourself , man . "
26327	26362	26260	26260	He	89	" Well , I mean like this . After the racket last night this young Mr. Marston gets the wind up and poisons himself . And Rogers , he gets the wind up too and bumps
26374	26374	26260	26260	He	89	"
26391	26421	26377	26377	his	81	" Yes , I 'd forgotten that . Not a natural thing to be carrying about with you . But how did it get into his drink , sir ? "
26425	26478	26422	26422	Lombard	69	" I 've been thinking about that . Marston had several drinks that night . Between the time he had his last one and the time he finished the one before it , there was quite a gap . During that time his glass was lying about on some table or other . I
26515	26515	26502	26502	Somebody	965	"
26520	26529	26516	26516	Blore	89	" Without our all seeing him , sir ? "
26534	26542	26530	26530	Lombard	69	" We were all rather concerned elsewhere . "
26547	26583	26543	26543	Armstrong	81	" That 's true . We 'd all been attacked . We were walking about , moving about the room . Arguing , indignant , intent on our own business . I think it could have been
26586	26586	26543	26543	Armstrong	81	"
26592	26633	26634	26634	Lombard	69	" Fact is , it must have been done ! Now then , gentlemen , let 's make a start . Nobody 's got a revolver , by any chance ? I suppose that 's too much to hope for . "
26637	26643	26644	26644	He	69	" I 've got one . "
26663	26673	26656	26656	He	89	" Always carry that about with you , sir ? "
26677	26691	26674	26674	Lombard	69	" Usually . I 've been in some tight places , you know . "
26692	26695	26697	26697	Blore	89	" Oh , "
26701	26748	26697	26697	Blore	89	" Well , you 've probably never been in a tighter place than you are today ! If there 's a lunatic hiding on this island , he 's probably got a young arsenal on him to say nothing of a knife or dagger or two . "
26752	26774	26749	26749	Armstrong	81	" You may be wrong there , Blore . Many homicidal lunatics are very quiet , unassuming people . Delightful fellows . "
26778	26796	26775	26775	Blore	89	" I do n't feel this one is going to be of that kind , Dr. Armstrong . "
26975	26991	26973	26973	himself	89	" ' Tisn't natural looks as though he 'd gone into a trance or something . "
27004	27016	26992	26992	He	89	" Nice peaceful spot you 've found for yourself , sir . "
27033	27053	27054	27054	Blore	89	" There is so little time so little time . I really must insist that no one disturbs me . "
27058	27094	27054	27054	Blore	89	" We wo n't disturb you . We 're just making a tour of the island , so to speak . Just wondered , you know , if some one might be hiding on it . "
27101	27117	27095	27096	The General	669	" You do n't understand you do n't understand at all . Please go away . "
27131	27144	27125	27125	he	89	" He 's crazy ... It 's no good talking to him . "
27151	27157	27121	27121	He	89	" What did he say ? "
27163	27180	27181	27182	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Something about there being no time and that he did n't want to be disturbed . "
27188	27193	27185	27185	He	81	" I wonder now ... "
27232	27262	27229	27229	Lombard	69	" No fishing boats out . There 's a storm coming . Damned nuisance you ca n't see the village from here . We could signal or do something . "
27266	27274	27263	27263	Blore	89	" We might light a bonfire tonight . "
27280	27295	27275	27275	Lombard	69	" The devil of it is that that 's all probably been provided for . "
27296	27303	27263	27263	Blore	89	" In what way , sir ? "
27304	27344	27275	27275	Lombard	69	" How do I know ? Practical joke , perhaps . We 're to be marooned here , no attention is to be paid to signals , etc . Possibly the village has been told there 's a wager on .
27351	27351	27275	27275	Lombard	69	"
27356	27363	27352	27352	Blore	89	" Think they 'd swallow that ? "
27368	27401	27352	27352	Blore	89	" It 's easier of belief than the truth ! If the village were told that the island was to be isolated until Mr. Unknown Owen had quietly murdered all his guests do you
27408	27408	27364	27364	Lombard	69	"
27413	27427	27409	27410	Dr. Armstrong	81	" There are moments when I ca n't believe it myself . And yet "
27441	27456	27428	27429	Philip Lombard	69	" And yet that 's just it ! You 've said it , doctor ! "
27468	27479	27465	27465	He	89	" Nobody could have clambered down here , I suppose ? "
27485	27501	27482	27482	his	81	" I doubt it . It 's pretty sheer . And where could he hide ? "
27505	27529	27502	27502	Blore	89	" There might be a hole in the cliff . If we had a boat now , we could row round the island . "
27533	27551	27530	27530	Lombard	69	" If we had a boat , we 'd all be halfway to the mainland by now ! "
27552	27558	27502	27502	Blore	89	" True enough , sir . "
27563	27611	27559	27559	Lombard	69	" We can make sure of this cliff . There 's only one place where there could be a recess just a little to the right below here . If you fellows can get hold of a rope , you can let me down to make sure . "
27615	27643	27612	27612	Blore	89	" Might as well be sure . Though it seems absurd on the face of it ! I 'll see if I can get hold of something . "
27685	27698	27682	27682	He	89	" You 're very silent , doctor . What are you thinking ? "
27703	27714	27699	27699	Armstrong	81	" I was wondering exactly how mad old Macarthur was ... "
27975	27987	27959	27959	He	78	" How queer . It 's almost as though he knew ... "
27991	28002	27988	27988	He	78	" Ah ! it 's you ! You 've come ... "
28012	28023	28009	28009	She	100	" Do you like sitting here looking out to sea ? "
28030	28033	28034	28034	he	78	" Yes , "
28037	28054	28034	28034	he	78	" It 's pleasant . It 's a good place , I think , to wait . "
28055	28059	28061	28061	Vera	100	" To wait ? "
28064	28071	28061	28061	Vera	100	" What are you waiting for ? "
28076	28107	28072	28072	He	78	" The end . But I think you know that , do n't you ? It 's true , is n't it ? We 're all waiting for the end . "
28112	28118	28072	28072	He	78	" What do you mean ? "
28124	28161	28119	28120	General Macarthur	78	" None of us are going to leave the island . That 's the plan . You know it , of course , perfectly . What , perhaps , you ca n't understand is the relief ! "
28166	28170	28162	28162	Vera	100	" The relief ? "
28174	28197	28171	28171	He	78	" Yes . Of course , you 're very young ... you have n't got to that yet . But it does come !
28231	28231	28223	28223	You	100	"
28236	28243	28232	28232	Vera	100	" I do n't understand you . "
28263	28277	28259	28259	He	78	" You see , I loved Leslie . I loved her very much ... "
28282	28288	28278	28278	Vera	100	" Was Leslie your wife ? "
28289	28314	28315	28315	He	78	" Yes , my wife ... I loved her and I was very proud of her . She was so pretty and so gay . "
28328	28342	28325	28325	he	78	" Yes , I loved Leslie . That 's why I did it . "
28346	28349	28343	28343	Vera	100	" You mean "
28360	28441	28456	28456	He	78	" It 's not much good denying it now not when we 're all going to die . I sent Richmond to his death . I suppose , in a way , it was murder . Curious . Murder and I 've always been such a lawabiding man ! But it did n't seem like that at the time . I had no regrets . ' Serves him damned well right ! ' that 's what I thought . But afterwards "
28450	28455	28447	28447	Vera	100	" Well , afterwards ? "
28470	28494	28458	28458	his	78	" I do n't know . I do n't know . It was all different , you see . I do n't know if Leslie
28538	28538	28531	28531	she	1006	"
28542	28545	28550	28550	her	100	" Alone alone "
28564	28577	28560	28561	General Macarthur	78	" You 'll be glad , too , when the end comes . "
28586	28595	28582	28582	She	100	" I do n't know what you mean ! "
28599	28609	28596	28596	He	78	" I know , my child , I know ... "
28610	28622	28640	28640	He	78	" You do n't . You do n't understand at all ... "
28647	28651	28640	28640	He	78	" Leslie ... ? "
28685	28691	28681	28681	Blore	89	" Where 's Mr. Lombard ? "
28696	28722	28692	28692	Armstrong	81	" Gone to test some theory or other . He 'll be back in a minute . Look here , Blore , I 'm worried . "
28723	28732	28667	28667	he	89	" I should say we were all worried . "
28740	28761	28733	28734	The doctor	310	" Of course of course . I do n't mean it that way . I 'm thinking of old Macarthur . "
28762	28769	28733	28734	The doctor	310	" What about him , sir ? "
28775	28789	28770	28771	Dr. Armstrong	81	" What we 're looking for is a madman . What price Macarthur ? "
28794	28801	28790	28790	Blore	89	" You mean he 's homicidal ? "
28806	28851	28802	28802	Armstrong	81	" I should n't have said so . Not for a minute . But of course I 'm not a specialist in mental diseases . I have n't really had any conversation with him I have n't studied him from that point of view . "
28856	28868	28852	28852	Blore	89	" Ga ga , yes ! But I would n't have said "
28885	28911	28869	28869	Armstrong	81	" You 're probably right ! Damn it all , there must be some one hiding on the island ! Ah ! here comes Lombard . "
28921	28941	28918	28918	Lombard	94	" I 'll help myself all I can . Keep a lookout for a sudden strain on the rope , "
28960	28970	28957	28957	Blore	89	" Climbs like a cat , does n't he ? "
28983	28997	28976	28976	his	89	" I should think he must have done some mountaineering in his time . "
28998	29001	28976	28976	his	89	" Maybe . "
29011	29024	29007	29008	the exinspector	894	" Funny sort of cove altogether . D'you know what I think ? "
29025	29028	29052	29052	he	89	" What ? "
29029	29037	29007	29008	the exinspector	894	" He 's a wrong ’ un ! "
29042	29047	29038	29038	Armstrong	81	" In what way ? "
29055	29071	29052	29052	he	89	" I do n't know exactly . But I would n't trust him a yard . "
29076	29086	29072	29073	Dr. Armstrong	81	" I suppose he 's led an adventurous life . "
29090	29105	29106	29106	He	89	" I bet some of his adventures have had to be kept pretty dark . "
29113	29127	29106	29106	He	89	" Did you happen to bring a revolver along with you , doctor ? "
29131	29143	29154	29154	Armstrong	81	" Me ? Good Lord , no . Why should I ? "
29147	29153	29154	29154	Armstrong	81	" Why did Mr. Lombard ? "
29158	29163	29154	29154	Armstrong	81	" I suppose habit . "
29194	29207	29191	29191	Blore	89	" There are habits and habits ! Mr. Lombard takes a revolver to outoftheway
29258	29258	29248	29248	people	1895	"
29309	29312	29313	29313	he	94	" Well , "
29316	29330	29313	29313	he	94	" We 're up against it . It 's the house or nowhere . "
29429	29444	29424	29425	Philip Lombard	69	" Wonderful animal , the good servant . Carries on with an impassive countenance . "
29449	29463	29445	29445	Armstrong	81	" Rogers is a firstclass butler , I 'll say that for him ! "
29467	29482	29464	29464	Blore	89	" His wife was a pretty good cook , too . That dinner last night "
29512	29520	29509	29509	Blore	89	" There 's a little stair here . "
29525	29535	29521	29522	Dr. Armstrong	81	" It leads up to the servants ' room . "
29539	29566	29536	29536	Blore	89	" There must be a place under the roof for cisterns , water tank , etc . It 's the best chance and the only one ! "
29609	29613	29602	29602	Lombard	69	" Quiet listen . "
29629	29647	29626	29626	Armstrong	81	" He 's actually in the bedroom itself . The room where Mrs. Rogers ' body is . "
29652	29676	29648	29648	Blore	89	" Of course ! Best hidingplace he could have chosen ! Nobody likely to go there . Now then quiet as you can . "
29716	29719	29713	29713	Blore	89	" Now . "
29763	29779	29760	29760	He	89	" Sorry er Rogers . Heard some one moving about in here , and thought well "
29786	29822	29783	29783	Rogers	90	" I 'm sorry , gentlemen . I was just moving my things . I take it there will be no objection if I take one of the vacant guest chambers on the floor below ? The
29826	29826	29783	29783	Rogers	90	"
29839	29851	29836	29836	Armstrong	81	" Of course . Of course . Get on with it . "
29867	29873	29864	29864	Rogers	90	" Thank you , sir . "
29932	29951	29929	29929	Armstrong	81	" Wish I 'd got my stuff here . I 'd like to know what drug it was . "
29960	29980	29981	29981	Blore	89	" Let 's get finished . I feel it in my bones we 're not going to find anything . "
29995	30022	29992	29992	He	89	" That chap moves damned quietly . A minute or two ago we saw him in the garden . None of us heard him come upstairs . "
30026	30044	30023	30023	Lombard	69	" I suppose that 's why we assumed it must be a stranger moving about up here . "
30109	30136	30105	30105	Lombard	69	" So we 've been wrong wrong all along ! Built up a nightmare of superstition and fantasy all because of the coincidence of two deaths ! "
30141	30175	30137	30137	Armstrong	81	" And yet , you know , the argument holds . Hang it all , I 'm a doctor , I know something about suicides . Anthony Marston was n't a suicidal type . "
30180	30193	30176	30176	Lombard	69	" It could n't , I suppose , have been an accident ? "
30199	30206	30207	30207	he	89	" Damned queer sort of accident , "
30219	30223	30216	30216	Blore	89	" About the woman "
30227	30231	30176	30176	Lombard	69	" Mrs. Rogers ? "
30232	30251	30252	30253	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes . It 's possible , is n't it , that that might have been an accident ? "
30256	30264	30252	30253	Philip Lombard	69	" An accident ? In what way ? "
30289	30305	30280	30280	He	89	" Look here , doctor , you did give her some dope , you know . "
30311	30319	30373	30373	Blore	89	" Dope ? What do you mean ? "
30320	30337	30373	30373	Blore	89	" Last night . You said yourself you 'd give her something to make her sleep . "
30338	30349	30373	30373	Blore	89	" Oh , that , yes . A harmless sedative . "
30350	30356	30373	30373	Blore	89	" What was it exactly ? "
30357	30372	30373	30373	Blore	89	" I gave her a mild dose of trional . A perfectly harmless preparation . "
30381	30399	30378	30378	He	89	" Look here not to mince matters you did n't give her an overdose , did you ? "
30405	30414	30400	30401	Dr. Armstrong	81	" I do n't know what you mean . "
30418	30443	30415	30415	Blore	89	" It 's possible , is n't it , that you may have made a mistake ? These things do happen once in awhile . "
30448	30461	30462	30462	He	89	" I did nothing of the sort . The suggestion is ridiculous , "
30472	30486	30462	30462	He	89	" Or do you suggest that I gave her an overdose on purpose ? "
30492	30514	30487	30488	Philip Lombard	69	" Look here , you two , got to keep our heads . Do n't let 's start slinging accusations about . "
30519	30530	30515	30515	Blore	89	" I only suggested the doctor had made a mistake . "
30550	30565	30542	30542	his	81	" Doctors ca n't afford to make mistakes of that kind , my friend . "
30570	30589	30566	30566	Blore	89	" It would n't be the first you 've made if that gramophone record is to be believed ! "
30603	30638	30594	30595	Philip Lombard	69	" What 's the sense of making yourself offensive ? We 're all in the same boat . We 've got to pull together . What about your own pretty little spot of perjury ? "
30656	30694	30649	30649	He	89	" Perjury be damned ! That 's a foul lie ! You may try and shut me up , Mr. Lombard , but there 's things I want to know and one of them is about you ! "
30700	30704	30649	30649	He	89	" About me ? "
30705	30725	30649	30649	He	89	" Yes . I want to know why you brought a revolver down here on a pleasant social visit ? "
30729	30736	30726	30726	Lombard	94	" You do , do you ? "
30737	30746	30649	30649	He	89	" Yes , I do , Mr. Lombard . "
30751	30768	30747	30747	Lombard	94	" You know , Blore , you 're not nearly such a fool as you look . "
30769	30781	30649	30649	He	89	" That 's as may be . What about that revolver ? "
30785	30800	30782	30782	Lombard	94	" I brought it because I expected to run into a spot of trouble . "
30805	30815	30801	30801	Blore	89	" You did n't tell us that last night . "
30821	30829	30830	30830	Blore	89	" You were holding out on us ? "
30833	30840	30842	30842	Lombard	94	" In a way , yes , "
30844	30854	30801	30801	Blore	89	" Well , come on , out with it . "
30859	30897	30855	30855	Lombard	94	" I allowed you all to think that I was asked here in the same way as most of the others , That 's not quite true . As a matter of fact I was approached by a little
30935	30935	30920	30920	I	0	"
30936	30939	30940	30940	Blore	89	" Well ? "
30950	30955	30944	30944	Lombard	94	" That 's all . "
30960	30970	30956	30957	Dr. Armstrong	81	" But surely he told you more than that ? "
30971	31008	31009	31009	Blore	89	" Oh , no , he did n't . Just shut up like a clam . I could take it or leave it those were his words . I was hard up . I took it . "
31016	31028	31013	31013	He	89	" Why did n't you tell us all this last night ? "
31029	31033	31034	31034	Lombard	94	" My dear man "
31039	31063	31034	31034	Lombard	94	" How was I to know that last night was n't exactly the eventuality I was here to cope with ? I lay low and
31069	31069	31070	31071	Dr. Armstrong	81	"
31075	31082	31070	31071	Dr. Armstrong	81	" But now you think differently ? "
31096	31140	31093	31093	He	94	" Yes , I believe now that I 'm in the same boat as the rest of you . That hundred guineas was just Mr. Owen 's little bit of cheese to get me into the trap along with the rest of you . "
31145	31181	31141	31141	He	94	" For we are in a trap I 'll take my oath on that ! Mrs. Rogers ' death ! Tony Marston 's ! The disappearing Indian boys on the dinnertable ! Oh , yes , Mr.
31199	31209	31197	31197	himself	54	" Downstairs the gong pealed a solemn call to lunch .
31242	31276	31234	31234	He	163	" I hope lunch will be satisfactory . There is cold ham and cold tongue , and I 've boiled some potatoes . And there 's cheese and biscuits and some tinned fruits . "
31280	31292	31277	31277	Lombard	94	" Sounds all right . Stores are holding out , then ? "
31293	31312	31234	31234	He	163	" There is plenty of food , sir of a tinned variety . The larder is very well stocked .
31341	31341	31322	31322	sir	1920	"
31357	31380	31345	31345	Rogers	90	" It wormes me that Fred Narracott has n't been over today . It 's peculiarly unfortunate , as you might say , "
31381	31384	31386	31386	Lombard	94	" Yes , "
31388	31396	31386	31386	Lombard	94	" peculiarly unfortunate describes it very well . "
31431	31451	31428	31428	she	74	" The weather is changing . The wind is quite strong and there are white horses on the sea . "
31486	31494	31483	31483	He	53	" You have had an active morning . "
31522	31536	31518	31518	She	129	" I hope you did n't wait for me . Am I late ? "
31541	31555	31537	31538	Emily Brent	74	" You 're not the last . The General is n't here yet . "
31567	31579	31562	31562	Rogers	90	" Will you begin , Madam , or will you wait ? "
31583	31606	31607	31607	she	129	" General Macarthur is sitting right down by the sea . I do n't expect he would hear the gong there and anyway "
31609	31620	31621	31621	Rogers	90	" he 's a little vague today , I think . "
31625	31637	31621	31621	Rogers	90	" I will go down and inform him luncheon is ready . "
31643	31648	31649	31649	he	81	" I 'll go , "
31652	31658	31649	31649	he	81	" You others start lunch . "
31672	31684	31668	31668	Rogers	90	" Will you take cold tongue or cold ham , Madam ? "
31717	31724	31710	31710	Vera	129	" There is a storm coming . "
31737	31768	31733	31733	He	89	" There was an old fellow in the train from Plymouth yesterday . He kept saying a storm was coming . Wonderful how they know weather , these old salts . "
31800	31806	31792	31792	He	81	" There 's somebody running ... "
31860	31863	31857	31857	He	81	" General Macarthur "
31864	31867	31872	31872	Vera	129	" Dead ! "
31878	31885	31875	31875	Armstrong	81	" Yes , he 's dead ... "
32028	32039	32025	32025	He	1075	" Oh , Miss , 11 just came to see ... "
32051	32068	32048	32048	Vera	129	" You 're quite right , Rogers . Look for yourself . There are only seven ... "
32183	32188	32175	32175	He	310	" Well , doctor ? "
32197	32226	32194	32194	He	81	" No question of heart failure or anything like that . Macarthur was hit with a life preserver or some such thing on the back of the head . "
32245	32254	32238	32239	the judge	375	" Did you find the actual weapon used ? "
32255	32258	32238	32239	the judge	375	" No . "
32259	32268	32238	32239	the judge	375	" Nevertheless you are sure of your facts ? "
32269	32274	32238	32239	the judge	375	" Iam quite sure . "
32281	32290	32275	32277	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" We know now exactly where we are . "
32353	32394	32348	32348	he	53	" This morning , gentlemen , whilst I was sitting on the terrace . I was an observer of your activities . There could be little doubt of your purpose . You were searching the island for an unknown murderer ? "
32395	32401	32403	32404	Philip Lombard	69	" Quite right , sir , "
32411	32439	32406	32407	The judge	375	" You had come , doubtless , to the same conclusion that I had namely that the deaths of Anthony Marston and Mrs. Rogers were neither accidental nor were
32465	32465	32445	32445	you	53	"
32470	32479	32466	32466	Blore	89	" He 's a madman ! A loony . "
32484	32499	32480	32481	The judge	375	" That almost certainly . But it hardly affects the issue . Our main preoccupation is
32506	32506	32480	32481	The judge	375	"
32514	32530	32507	32507	Armstrong	81	" There 's no one on the island , I tell you . No one ! "
32541	32575	32537	32537	He	375	" In the sense you mean , no . I came to that conclusion early this morning . I could have told you that your search would be fruitless . Nevertheless I am strongly of
32656	32669	32670	32670	VI	100	" It is perfectly clear . Mr. Owen is one of us ... "
32671	32680	32670	32670	VI	100	" Oh , no , no , no ... "
32704	32746	32701	32701	He	375	" My dear young lady , this is no time for refusing to look facts in the face . We are all in grave danger . One of us is U.N. Owen . And we do not know which of us . Of
32801	32801	32795	32799	a bogus little Indian boy	1099	"
32808	32818	32802	32802	He	375	" Do I take it that you all agree ? "
32822	32833	32819	32819	Armstrong	81	" It 's fantastic but I suppose you 're right . "
32837	32856	32834	32834	Blore	89	" Not a doubt of it . And if you ask me , I 've a very good idea "
32874	32900	32869	32870	The judge	375	" We will come to that presently . At the moment all I wish to establish is that we are in agreement on the facts . "
32909	32927	32928	32928	Vera	100	" Your argument seems logical . I agree that one of us is possessed by a devil . "
32931	32942	32928	32928	Vera	100	" I ca n't believe it ... I ca n't ... "
32946	32949	32943	32943	Wargrave	53	" Lombard ? "
32950	32958	32943	32943	Wargrave	53	" I agree , sir , absolutely . "
32972	33007	32969	32969	He	375	" Now let us examine the evidence . To begin with , is there any reason for suspecting one particular person ? Mr. Blore , you have , I think , something to say . "
33016	33036	33013	33013	He	89	" Lombard 's got a revolver . He did n't tell the truth last night . He admits it . "
33045	33054	33042	33042	He	69	" I suppose I 'd better explain again . "
33070	33085	33066	33066	Blore	89	" What 's to prove it ? There 's nothing to corroborate your story . "
33090	33093	33094	33094	he	375	" Unfortunately , "
33097	33115	33094	33094	he	375	" we are all in that position . There is only our own word to go upon . "
33120	33154	33116	33116	He	375	" You have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is . To my mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt . Is there any one whom we
33169	33169	33116	33116	He	375	"
33175	33192	33170	33171	Dr. Armstrong	81	" I am a wellknown professional man . The mere idea that I can be suspected of "
33220	33241	33215	33215	his	53	" I , too , am a wellknown person ! But , my dear sir , that proves less than nothing !
33256	33264	33295	33295	He	69	" he added , looking at Blore , "
33268	33268	33266	33266	policemen	1108	"
33272	33288	33269	33269	Lombard	69	" At any rate , I suppose you 'll leave the women out of it . "
33300	33302	33295	33295	He	69	" acid "
33310	33326	33327	33327	Lombard	69	" Do I understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal mania ? "
33331	33345	33346	33346	He	69	" Of course not . But all the same , it hardly seems possible "
33362	33387	33349	33351	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I take it , Dr. Armstrong , that a woman would have been physically capable of striking the blow that killed poor Macarthur ? "
33393	33409	33388	33389	The doctor	310	" Perfectly capable given a suitable instrument , such as a rubber truncheon or cosh . "
33410	33420	33388	33389	The doctor	310	" It would require no undue exertion of force ? "
33421	33426	33388	33389	The doctor	310	" Not at all . "
33438	33470	33435	33435	He	53	" The other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs . That , no one will dispute , is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength . "
33475	33482	33471	33471	Vera	100	" I think you 're mad ! "
33513	33526	33510	33510	She	100	" He 's just seeing me as a as a specimen . And "
33535	33543	33547	33548	the judge	375	" he does n't like me much ! "
33552	33571	33547	33548	the judge	375	" My dear young lady , do try and restrain your feelings . I am not accusing you . "
33578	33591	33572	33572	He	53	" I hope , Miss Brent , that you are not offended by my
33602	33602	33618	33618	she	74	"
33621	33672	33618	33618	she	74	" The idea that I should be accused of taking a fellow creature 's life not to speak of the lives of three fellow creatures is , of course , quite absurd to any one who knows anything of my character . But I quite appreciate the fact that we are all
33705	33705	33696	33696	I	0	"
33710	33730	33706	33707	The judge	375	" Then we are agreed . There can be no elimination on the ground of character or position alone . "
33734	33739	33731	33731	Lombard	69	" What about Rogers ? "
33747	33752	33740	33741	The judge	375	" What about him ? "
33756	33770	33753	33753	Lombard	69	" Well , to my mind , Rogers seems pretty well ruled out . "
33776	33784	33771	33773	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Indeed , and on what grounds ? "
33788	33810	33785	33785	Lombard	69	" He has n't got the brains for one thing . And for another his wife was one of the victims . "
33823	33850	33820	33820	He	375	" In my time , young man , several people have come before me accused of the murders of their wives and have been found guilty . "
33851	33885	33820	33820	He	375	" Oh ! I agree . Wife murder is perfectly possible almost natural , let 's say ! But not this particular kind ! I can believe in Rogers killing his wife because he was
33953	33953	33932	33935	the lunatic Mr. Owen	54	"
33959	34028	33954	33956	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" You are assuming hearsay to be evidence . We do not know that Rogers and his wife conspired to murder their employer . That may have been a false statement , made so that Rogers should appear to be in the same position as ourselves . Mrs. Rogers ' terror last night may have been due to the fact that she realized her husband was mentally unhinged . "
34032	34051	34029	34029	Lombard	69	" Well , have it your own way , U.N. Owen is one of us . No exceptions allowed .
34056	34056	34052	34052	We	1123	"
34062	34078	34057	34059	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" My point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of character ,
34151	34151	34148	34149	General Macarthur	78	"
34164	34172	34173	34173	he	89	" Now you 're talking , sir ! "
34176	34219	34173	34173	he	89	" That 's the stuff ! Let 's go into it . As regards young Marston I do n't think there 's anything to be done . It 's already been suggested that some one from outside slipped something into the dregs of his
34268	34268	34269	34269	He	0	"
34276	34307	34269	34269	He	0	" Now take the woman Rogers . The people who stand out there are her husband and the doctor . Either of them could have done it as easy as winking "
34318	34338	34269	34269	He	0	" I protest This is absolutely uncalled for ! I swear that the dose I gave the woman was perfectly "
34339	34343	34269	34269	He	0	" Dr. Armstrong . "
34371	34400	34351	34352	The doctor	310	" Your indignation is very natural . Nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced . Either you or Rogers could have administered a fatal dose
34453	34457	34458	34458	I	0	" He paused . "
34462	34462	34458	34458	I	0	"
34467	34483	34463	34463	Vera	129	" I was nowhere near the woman ! All of you can swear to that . "
34495	34527	34492	34492	he	53	" As far as my memory serves me the facts were these will any one please correct me if I make a misstatement ? Mrs. Rogers was lifted onto the sofa by Anthony
34588	34588	34575	34576	Miss Brent	74	"
34607	34612	34604	34604	She	74	" This is outrageous ! "
34620	34642	34595	34596	Emily Brent	74	" When we returned to this room , you , Miss Brent , were bending over the woman on the sofa . "
34647	34655	34643	34644	Emily Brent	74	" Is common humanity a criminal offence ? "
34661	34675	34656	34658	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I am only establishing facts . Rogers then entered the room with the brandy
34720	34723	34713	34714	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Blore said :
34724	34747	34748	34748	His	1144	" That 's what happened . Absolutely . And that lets out the judge , Mr. Lombard , myself and Miss Claythorne . "
34770	34786	34755	34757	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Ah , but does it ? We must take into account every possible eventuality . "
34793	34800	34790	34790	He	166	" I do n't get you . "
34806	34838	34801	34803	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Upstairs in her room , Mrs. Rogers is lying in bed . The sedative that the doctor has given her begins to take effect . She is vaguely sleepy and acquiescent .
34904	34904	34885	34885	you	1149	"
34921	34956	34917	34918	Philip Lombard	69	" I do n't believe in that story for a minute . Besides none of us left this room for hours afterwards . There was Marston 's death and all the rest of it . "
34961	34973	34957	34958	The judge	375	" Some one could have left his or her bedroom later . "
34977	34987	34974	34974	Lombard	69	" But then Rogers would have been up there . "
34992	34995	34996	34996	he	81	" No , "
34999	35028	34996	34996	he	81	" Rogers went downstairs to clear up in the diningroom and pantry . Any one could have gone up to the woman 's bedroom then without being seen . "
35033	35057	35029	35030	Emily Brent	74	" Surely , doctor , the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the influence of the drug you had administered ? "
35058	35120	35121	35121	Lombard	69	" In all likelihood , yes . But it is not a certainty . Until you have prescribed for a patient more than once you can not tell their reaction to different drugs . There is , sometimes , a considerable period before a sedative takes effect . It depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the patient towards that particular drug . "
35124	35139	35121	35121	Lombard	69	" Of course you would say that , doctor . Suits your book eh ? "
35162	35177	35121	35121	Lombard	69	" No good result can come from recrimination . Facts are what we have to deal
35298	35298	35355	35355	He	53	"
35302	35309	35299	35299	Blore	89	" And that gets us where ? "
35327	35354	35316	35316	his	53	" We have now dealt with the second killing , and have established the fact that no one of us can be completely exonerated from suspicion . "
35361	35377	35355	35355	He	53	" We come now to the death of General Macarthur . That took place this morning .
35434	35467	35413	35413	I	0	" I sat on that chair on the terrace for the whole morning until the gong went , but there were , I should imagine , several periods during the morning when I was
35525	35525	35549	35550	Dr. Armstrong	81	"
35529	35548	35526	35526	Blore	89	" I was with Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong all the morning . They 'll bear me out . "
35553	35563	35549	35550	Dr. Armstrong	81	" You went to the house for a rope . "
35567	35586	35587	35587	Armstrong	81	" Of course , I did . Went straight there and straight back . You know I did . "
35590	35597	35587	35587	Armstrong	81	" You were a long time ... "
35605	35618	35602	35602	He	89	" What the hell do you mean by that , Dr. Armstrong ? "
35622	35632	35619	35619	Armstrong	81	" I only said you were a long time . "
35633	35658	35659	35661	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Had to find it , did n't I ? Ca n't lay your hands on a coil of rope all in a minute . "
35664	35677	35678	35678	Armstrong	81	" During Inspector Blore 's absence , were you two gentlemen together ? "
35682	35702	35659	35661	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Certainly . That is , Lombard went off for a few minutes . I remained where I was . "
35709	35738	35659	35661	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I wanted to test the possibilities of heliographing to the mainland . Wanted to find the best spot . I was only absent a minute or two . "
35745	35762	35742	35742	He	81	" That 's right . Not long enough to do a murder , I assure you . "
35767	35778	35763	35764	The judge	375	" Did either of you two glance at your watches ? "
35779	35784	35763	35764	The judge	375	" Well , no . "
35789	35796	35785	35786	Philip Lombard	69	" I was n't wearing one . "
35802	35812	35797	35798	The judge	375	" A minute or two is a vague expression . "
35829	35833	35813	35813	He	375	" Miss Brent ? "
35838	35864	35834	35835	Emily Brent	74	" I took a walk with Miss Claythorne up to the top of the island . Afterwards I sat on the terrace in the sun . "
35869	35879	35865	35866	The judge	375	" I do n't think I noticed you there . "
35880	35903	35865	35866	The judge	375	" No , I was round the corner of the house to the east . It was out of the wind there . "
35904	35913	35865	35866	The judge	375	" And you sat there till lunch time ? "
35914	35917	35865	35866	The judge	375	" Yes . "
35918	35922	35865	35866	The judge	375	" Miss Claythorne ? "
35929	35957	35865	35866	The judge	375	" I was with Miss Brent early this morning . After that I wandered about a bit . Then I went down and talked to General Macarthur . "
35966	35972	35963	35963	He	53	" What time was that ? "
35984	36005	35981	35981	She	129	" I do n't know . About an hour before lunch , I think or it might have been less . "
36009	36021	36006	36006	Blore	166	" Was it after we 'd spoken to him or before ? "
36025	36037	36022	36022	Vera	129	" I do n't know . He he was very queer . "
36041	36049	36050	36051	the judge	375	" In what way was he queer ? "
36063	36086	36056	36056	Vera	129	" He said we were all going to die he said he was waiting for the end . He he frightened me ... "
36094	36101	36091	36091	He	375	" What did you do next ? "
36102	36134	36091	36091	He	375	" I went back to the house . Then , just before lunch , I went out again and up behind the house . I 've been terribly restless all day . "
36145	36165	36142	36142	He	53	" There remains Rogers . Though I doubt if his evidence will add anything to our sum of knowledge . "
36295	36304	36289	36289	Lombard	94	" The summing up will now take place ! "
36309	36352	36305	36306	The judge	375	" We have inquired into the circumstances of these three deaths to the best of our ability . Whilst probability in some cases is against certain people being implicated , yet we can not say definitely that any one person can be considered as
36449	36484	36487	36488	the murderer	1180	" I would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any suggestions that may occur to you . In the meantime I warn everybody to be upon his or her guard .
36536	36536	36541	36541	his	69	"
36544	36551	36541	36541	his	69	" The court will now adjourn ... "
36554	36560	36561	36561	Vera	129	" Do you believe it ? "
36609	36630	36606	36606	he	69	" You mean , do I believe that old Wargrave is right when he says it 's one of us ? "
36631	36634	36606	36606	he	69	" Yes . "
36640	36658	36635	36636	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's difficult to say . Logically , you know , he 's right , and yet "
36668	36676	36659	36659	Vera	129	" And yet it seems so incredible ! "
36683	36726	36677	36678	Philip Lombard	69	" The whole thing 's incredible ! But after Macarthur 's death there 's no more doubt as to one thing . There 's no question now of accidents or suicides . It 's definitely murder . Three murders up to date . "
36733	36752	36730	36730	She	129	" It 's like some awful dream . I keep feeling that things like this ca n't happen ! "
36758	36776	36753	36753	He	69	" I know . Presently a tap will come on the door , and early morning tea will be
36780	36780	36753	36753	He	69	"
36784	36794	36781	36781	Vera	129	" Oh , how I wish that could happen ! "
36800	36830	36795	36796	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes , but it wo n't ! We 're all in the dream ! And we 've got to be pretty much upon our guard from now on . "
36838	36853	36831	36831	Vera	129	" If if it is one of them which do you think it is ? "
36862	36901	36859	36859	He	69	" I take it you are excepting our two selves ? Well , that 's all right . I know very well that I 'm not the murderer , and I do n't fancy that there 's anything insane about
36933	36933	36924	36924	I	0	"
36943	36947	36940	36940	Vera	129	" Thank you . "
36951	36968	36948	36948	He	69	" Come now , Miss Vera Claythorne , are n't you going to return the compliment ? "
36978	37012	36975	36975	she	129	" You 've admitted , you know , that you do n't hold human life particularly sacred , but all the same I ca n't see you as as the man who dictated that gramophone
37015	37015	36975	36975	she	129	"
37019	37057	37016	37016	Lombard	69	" Quite right . If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what I could get out of them . This mass clearance is n't my line of country . Good , then
37097	37097	37091	37091	I	0	"
37098	37101	37102	37102	Vera	129	" Oh ! "
37116	37119	37106	37106	She	129	" Why ? "
37120	37160	37091	37091	I	0	" Hard to say exactly . But to begin with , he 's an old man and he 's been presiding over courts of law for years . That is to say , he 's played God Almighty for a good
37218	37218	37255	37255	Lombard	69	"
37223	37232	37219	37219	Vera	129	" Yes , I suppose that 's possible ... "
37236	37243	37233	37233	Lombard	69	" Who do you plump for ? "
37250	37254	37247	37247	Vera	129	" Dr. Armstrong . "
37261	37279	37255	37255	Lombard	69	" The doctor , eh ? You know , I should have put him last of all . "
37285	37322	37280	37280	Vera	129	" Oh , no ! Two of the deaths have been poison . That rather points to a doctor . And then you ca n't get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain Mrs.
37334	37334	37330	37330	he	69	"
37338	37345	37335	37335	Lombard	69	" Yes , that 's true . "
37349	37377	37346	37346	Vera	129	" If a doctor went mad , it would be a long time before any one suspected . And doctors overwork and have a lot of strain . "
37382	37416	37378	37379	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes but I doubt if he could have killed Macarthur . He would n't have had time during that brief interval when I left him not , that is , unless he fairly hared
37443	37443	37424	37424	I	0	"
37447	37461	37444	37444	Vera	129	" He did n't do it then . He had an opportunity later . "
37462	37465	37444	37444	Vera	129	" When ? "
37466	37478	37444	37444	Vera	129	" When he went down to call the General to lunch . "
37488	37503	37485	37485	He	69	" So you think he did it then ? Pretty cool thing to do . "
37508	37543	37504	37504	Vera	129	" What risk was there ? He 's the only person here with medical knowledge . He can swear the body 's been dead at least an hour and who 's to contradict him ? "
37550	37554	37555	37555	he	69	" You know , "
37558	37569	37555	37555	he	69	" that 's a clever idea of yours . I wonder "
37571	37591	37592	37592	Rogers	90	" Who is it , Mr. Blore ? That 's what I want to know . Who is it ? "
37617	37628	37613	37614	Exinspector Blore	89	" Eh , my lad , that 's the question ! "
37629	37659	37592	37592	Rogers	90	" One of us , ' is lordship said . Which one ? That 's what I want to know . Who 's the fiend in ' uman form ? "
37660	37663	37665	37665	Blore	89	" That , "
37667	37677	37665	37665	Blore	89	" is what we all would like to know . "
37682	37703	37678	37678	Rogers	90	" But you 've got an idea , Mr. Blore . You 've got an idea , ' aven't you ? "
37704	37711	37713	37713	Blore	89	" I may have an idea , "
37716	37726	37713	37713	Blore	89	" But that 's a long way from being sure .
37757	37757	37751	37754	a very cool customer	1191	"
37770	37784	37766	37766	He	1193	" It 's like a bad dream , that 's what it is . "
37793	37801	37785	37785	Blore	89	" Got any ideas yourself , Rogers ? "
37812	37836	37808	37808	He	493	" I do n't know . I do n't know at all . And that 's what 's frightening the life out of me .
37842	37842	37808	37808	He	493	"
37849	37865	37843	37845	Ill Dr. Armstrong	81	" We must get out of here we must we must ! At all costs ! "
37889	37938	37886	37886	He	53	" I do not , of course , profess to be a weather prophet . But I should say that it is very unlikely that a boat could reach us even if they knew of our plight under twentyfour hours and even then only if the wind drops . "
37953	37967	37950	37950	He	81	" And in the meantime we may all be murdered in our beds ? "
37968	37973	37975	37977	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I hope not , "
37979	37993	37975	37977	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I intend to take every possible precaution against such a thing happening . "
38063	38085	38057	38059	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Murdered in our beds ! These doctors are all the same they think in clichns . A thoroughly commonplace mind . "
38090	38100	38086	38087	The doctor	310	" There have been three victims already , remember . "
38101	38120	38086	38087	The doctor	310	" Certainly . But you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack . We are forewarned . "
38126	38135	38121	38122	Dr. Armstrong	81	" What can we do ? Sooner or later "
38136	38140	38142	38144	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I think , "
38146	38156	38157	38157	Armstrong	81	" that there are several things we can do . "
38160	38172	38157	38157	Armstrong	81	" We 've no idea , even , who it can be "
38181	38194	38173	38174	The judge	375	" Oh , you know , I would n't quite say that . "
38200	38207	38195	38195	Armstrong	81	" Do you mean you know ? "
38214	38247	38208	38210	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" As regards actual evidence , such as is necessary in court , I admit that I have none . But it appears to me , reviewing the whole business , that one particular
38260	38260	38256	38256	I	0	"
38269	38275	38266	38266	He	81	" I do n't understand . "
38341	38372	38334	38334	She	169	" A terrible thing has happened . General Macarthur is dead . ( His cousin married Elsie MacPherson . ) There is no doubt but that he was murdered . After luncheon
38428	38428	38456	38456	she	169	"
38511	38526	38504	38504	She	169	" Did I write that ? Did I ? I must be going mad ... "
38578	38593	38575	38575	He	1213	" Shall I draw the curtains ? It would make it more cheerful like . "
38647	38657	38643	38644	Vera Claythorne	129	" Will you pour out tea , Miss Brent ? "
38663	38692	38658	38660	The elder woman	1217	" No , you do it , dear . That teapot is so heavy . And I have lost two skeins of my grey knittingwool . So annoying . "
38768	38787	38761	38761	He	1213	" Excuse me , sir , but does any one know what 's become of the bathroom curtain ? "
38797	38811	38761	38761	He	1213	" The bathroom curtain ? What the devil do you mean , Rogers ? "
38812	38843	38844	38846	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" It 's gone , sir , clean vanished . I was going round drawing all the curtains and the one in the lav bathroom was n't there any longer . "
38849	38856	38844	38846	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Was it there this morning ? "
38857	38864	38844	38846	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Oh , yes , sir . "
38868	38877	38865	38865	Blore	89	" What kind of a curtain was it ? "
38878	38891	38844	38846	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Scarlet oilsilk , sir . It went with the scarlet tiles . "
38895	38901	38892	38892	Lombard	69	" And it 's gone ? "
38902	38907	38844	38846	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Gone , sir . "
38918	38956	38914	38914	Blore	89	" Well after all what of it ? It 's mad but so 's everything else . Anyway , it does n't matter . You ca n't kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain . Forget about it . "
38960	38970	38957	38957	Rogers	90	" Yes , sir , thank you , sir . "
39052	39059	39049	39049	She	74	" I 'm going to bed . "
39063	39071	39060	39060	Vera	129	" I 'll go to bed too . "
39133	39144	39127	39127	Blore	89	" No need to tell 'em to lock their doors ! "
39148	39163	39164	39164	He	69	" Well , they 're all right for the night , at any rate ! "
39225	39239	39219	39220	the judge	375	" I need hardly advise you , gentlemen , to lock your doors . "
39243	39267	39240	39240	Blore	89	" And , what 's more , put a chair under the handle . There are ways of turning locks from the outside . "
39271	39286	39268	39268	Lombard	69	" My dear Blore , the trouble with you is you know too much ! "
39292	39306	39287	39288	The judge	375	" Goodnight , gentlemen . May we all meet safely in the morning ! "
39347	39353	39354	39354	he	1231	" That 's all right , "
39399	39413	39396	39396	He	1231	" I 'll see no one plays tricks tonight , at any rate . "
39505	39517	39500	39500	He	1231	" No more Indian tricks tonight I 've seen to that ... "
39633	39646	39628	39628	He	69	" I think the time has come to do something about this . "
39688	39704	39652	39652	he	69	" Sleeping the clock round ? Well , shows you 've got an easy conscience . "
39709	39715	39705	39705	Blore	89	" What 's the matter ? "
39719	39737	39716	39716	Lombard	69	" Anybody called you or brought you any tea ? Do you know what time it is ? "
39755	39775	39752	39752	He	89	" Twentyfive to ten . Would n't have believed I could have slept like that . Where 's Rogers ? "
39780	39790	39776	39777	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's a case of echo answers where ? "
39791	39796	39752	39752	He	89	" What d'you mean ? "
39805	39838	39802	39802	Lombard	69	" I mean that Rogers is missing . He is n't in his room or anywhere else . And there 's no kettle on and the kitchen fire is n't even lit . "
39848	39877	39845	39845	He	89	" Where the devil can he be ? Out on the island somewhere ? Wait till I get some clothes on . See if the others know anything . "
39967	39974	39964	39964	Lombard	69	" He got up all right . "
39990	40003	39975	39975	Vera	129	" You do n't think he 's hiding somewhere waiting for us ? "
40007	40034	40004	40004	Lombard	69	" My dear girl , I 'm prepared to think anything of any one ! My advice is that we keep together until we find him . "
40038	40048	40035	40035	Armstrong	81	" He must be out on the island somewhere . "
40063	40075	40049	40049	Blore	89	" Where 's Miss Brent got to that 's another mystery ? "
40102	40122	40099	40099	She	74	" The sea is as high as ever . I should n't think any boat could put out today . "
40126	40153	40123	40123	Blore	89	" Have you been wandering about the island alone , Miss Brent ? Do n't you realize that that 's an exceedingly foolish thing to do ? "
40158	40174	40154	40155	Emily Brent	74	" I assure you , Mr. Blore , that I kept an extremely sharp lookout . "
40181	40187	40178	40178	He	89	" Seen anything of Rogers ? "
40194	40209	40188	40189	Miss Brent	74	" Rogers ? No , I have n't seen him this morning . Why ? "
40241	40252	40238	40238	He	53	" He laid the table for breakfast , I see . "
40256	40265	40253	40253	Lombard	69	" He might have done that last night . "
40333	40339	40329	40329	She	129	" The Indians ! Look ! "
40432	40436	40438	40438	Armstrong	81	" Perfectly clear , "
40440	40449	40438	40438	Armstrong	81	" The murderer must have crept up behind him ,
40467	40467	40462	40462	he	562	"
40490	40500	40485	40487	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Would it have needed great force , doctor ? "
40505	40519	40520	40520	He	81	" A woman could have done it if that 's what you mean . "
40538	40540	40530	40531	Emily Brent	74	" The girl
40592	40592	40607	40607	He	89	"
40610	40619	40607	40607	He	89	" No fingerprints . Handle was wiped afterwards . "
40654	40678	40638	40638	She	129	" Do they keep bees on this island ? Tell me that . Where do we go for honey ? Ha ! ha ! "
40709	40750	40700	40700	She	129	" Do n't stare like that ! As though you thought I was mad . It 's sane enough what I 'm asking . Bees , hives , bees ! Oh , do n't you understand ? Have n't you read that
40841	40841	40855	40855	his	81	"
40884	40894	40881	40881	she	129	" Thank you ... I 'm all right now . "
40923	40943	40911	40911	She	129	" Miss Brent and I are getting you breakfast . Can you bring some sticks to light the fire ? "
40967	40979	40964	40964	Blore	89	" Well , you dealt with that all right , doctor . "
40984	41001	40980	40980	Armstrong	81	" Had to ! We ca n't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else . "
41006	41014	41002	41003	Philip Lombard	69	" She 's not a hysterical type . "
41018	41039	41015	41015	Armstrong	81	" Oh , no . Good healthy sensible girl . Just the sudden shock . It might happen to anybody . "
41093	41120	41089	41090	Emily Brent	74	" Thank you . We 'll be as quick as we can say half an hour to three quarters . The kettle 's got to boil . "
41134	41141	41121	41123	IV Exinspector Blore	89	" Know what I 'm thinking ? "
41146	41165	41142	41143	Philip Lombard	69	" As you 're just about to tell me , it 's not worth the trouble of guessing . "
41186	41220	41181	41181	He	89	" There was a case in America . Old gentleman and his wife both killed with an axe . Middle of the morning . Nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid .
41258	41262	41251	41251	they	1293	" He paused . "
41320	41320	41295	41296	That girl	1295	"
41326	41331	41321	41322	Philip Lombard	69	" It might be . "
41336	41352	41332	41332	Blore	89	" But the other ! So neat and prim wrapped up in that apron Mrs. Rogers '
41447	41447	41434	41434	She	2290	"
41454	41467	41448	41449	Philip Lombard	69	" That 's hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality , Blore . "
41477	41498	41469	41469	Blore	89	" And then she was out in her mackintosh , said she 'd been down to look at the sea . "
41508	41539	41505	41505	He	252	" Rogers was killed as he was chopping firewood that is to say first thing when he got up . The Brent woman would n't have needed to wander about outside for
41565	41565	41544	41544	you	1296	"
41569	41605	41566	41566	Blore	89	" You 're missing the point , Mr. Lombard . If the woman was innocent she 'd be too dead scared to go wandering about by herself . She 'd only do that if she knew that
41623	41623	41617	41617	she	1303	"
41628	41644	41624	41625	Philip Lombard	69	" That 's a good point ... Yes , I had n't thought of that . "
41652	41661	41645	41645	He	89	" Glad you do n't still suspect me . "
41667	41702	41703	41703	He	89	" I did start by thinking of you that revolver and the queer story you told or did n't tell . But I 've realized now that that was really a bit too obvious , "
41708	41717	41703	41703	He	89	" Hope you feel the same about me . "
41722	41773	41774	41774	He	69	" I may be wrong , of course , but I ca n't feel that you 've got enough imagination for this job . All I can say is , if you 're the criminal , you 're a damned fine actor and I take my hat off to you . "
41779	41801	41774	41774	He	69	" Just between ourselves , Blore , and taking into account that we 'll probably both be a couple of stiffs before another
41818	41818	41806	41806	you	69	"
41834	41870	41829	41829	He	89	" Does n't seem to make much odds now . Oh , well , here goes . Landor was innocent right enough . The gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away
41883	41883	41876	41876	you	69	"
41884	41891	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" If there were any witnesses , "
41898	41920	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" It 's just between you and me . Well , I hope you made a tidy bit out of it . "
41921	41945	41876	41876	you	69	" Did n't make what I should have done . Mean crowd , the Purcell gang . I got my promotion , though . "
41946	41957	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" And Landor got penal servitude and died in prison . "
41958	41972	41974	41974	Blore	89	" I could n't know he was going to die , could I ? "
41976	41985	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" No , that was your bad luck . "
41986	41994	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" Mine ? His , you mean . "
41995	42023	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" Yours , too . Because , as a result of it , it looks as though your own life is going to be cut unpleasantly short . "
42024	42027	41893	41893	Lombard	69	" Me ? "
42033	42069	42028	42028	Blore	89	" Do you think I 'm going to go the way of Rogers and the rest of them ? Not me ! I 'm watching out for myself pretty carefully , I can tell you . "
42073	42096	42070	42070	Lombard	69	" Oh , well I 'm not a betting man . And anyway if you were dead I would n't get paid . "
42097	42109	42028	42028	Blore	89	" Look here , Mr. Lombard , what do you mean ? "
42119	42138	42116	42116	He	69	" I mean , my dear Blore , that in my opinion you have n't got a chance ! "
42139	42142	42070	42070	Lombard	69	" What ? "
42143	42173	42116	42116	He	69	" Your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target . A criminal of the imagination of U.N. Owen can make rings round you any time he
42179	42179	42116	42116	He	69	"
42190	42196	42186	42186	He	69	" And what about you ? "
42209	42254	42206	42206	He	69	" I 've a pretty good imagination of my own . I 've been in tight places before now and got out of them ! I think I wo n't say more than that but I think I 'll get out of this one . "
42273	42298	42271	42271	herself	129	" Why did I make a hysterical fool of myself ? That was a mistake . Keep calm , my girl , keep calm . "
42311	42327	42302	42302	she	129	" Miss Claythorne was wonderful kept her head started off swimming after Cyril at once . "
42436	42444	42431	42432	Emily Brent	74	" Vera , that bacon is burning . "
42445	42462	42431	42432	Emily Brent	74	" Oh , sorry , Miss Brent , so it is . How stupid of me . "
42489	42498	42475	42475	Vera	129	" You 're wonderfully calm , Miss Brent . "
42508	42524	42499	42500	Emily Brent	74	" I was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fuss . "
42529	42541	42525	42525	Vera	129	" Repressed as a child ... That accounts for a lot ... "
42545	42551	42542	42542	She	129	" Are n't you afraid ? "
42558	42566	42552	42552	She	129	" Or do n't you mind dying ? "
42681	42690	42757	42757	He	1317	" The Lord is mindful of his own . "
42691	42712	42757	42757	He	1317	" Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ... "
42722	42752	42757	42757	He	1317	" We shall none of us leave this island ... Who had said that ? General Macarthur , of course , whose cousin had married Elsie MacPherson . He had n't
42866	42882	42859	42859	She	74	" Everything 's ready , is n't it ? We 'll take the breakfast in . "
42896	42908	42859	42859	She	74	" May I get you some more coffee , Miss Brent ? "
42909	42918	42859	42859	She	74	" Miss Claythorne , a slice of ham ? "
42919	42925	42859	42859	She	74	" Another piece of bacon ? "
42951	42962	42859	42859	She	74	" What next ? What next ? Who ? Which ? "
42963	42989	42859	42859	She	74	" Would it work ? I wonder . It 's worth trying . If there 's time . My God , if there 's time ... "
42990	43016	42859	42859	She	74	" Religious mania , that 's the ticket ... Looking at her , though , you can hardly believe it ... Suppose I 'm wrong ... "
43017	43051	42859	42859	She	74	" It 's crazy every thing 's crazy . I 'm going crazy . Wool disappearing red silk curtains it does n't make sense . I ca n't get the hang of it ... "
43052	43079	42859	42859	She	74	" The damned fool , he believed every word I said to him . It was easy ... I must be careful , though , very careful ...
43080	43095	42859	42859	She	74	" Six of those little china figures ... only six how many will there be by
43099	43099	42859	42859	She	74	"
43100	43108	43143	43143	his	53	" Who 'll have the last egg ? "
43109	43112	42859	42859	She	74	" Marmalade ? "
43113	43123	43143	43143	his	53	" Thanks , can I give you some ham ? "
43154	43184	43143	43143	his	53	" It would be advisable , I think , if we met to discuss the situation . Shall we say in half an hour 's time in the drawingroom ? "
43204	43213	43201	43201	She	129	" I 'll clear away and wash up . "
43218	43231	43214	43215	Philip Lombard	69	" We 'll bring the stuff out to the pantry for you . "
43232	43235	43214	43215	Philip Lombard	69	" Thanks . "
43251	43256	43248	43248	She	74	" Oh , dear . "
43261	43269	43257	43258	The judge	375	" Anything the matter , Miss Brent ? "
43274	43303	43257	43258	The judge	375	" I 'm sorry . I 'd like to help Miss Claythorne , but I do n't know how it is . I feel just a little giddy . "
43304	43309	43310	43311	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Giddy , eh ? "
43316	43329	43310	43311	Dr. Armstrong	81	" Quite natural . Delayed shock . I can give you something to "
43330	43333	43310	43311	Dr. Armstrong	81	" No ! "
43374	43383	43370	43370	He	81	" Just as you please , Miss Brent . "
43387	43411	43384	43384	She	74	" I do n't wish to take anything anything at all . I will just sit here quietly till the giddiness passes off . "
43423	43442	43420	43420	Blore	89	" I 'm a domestic sort of man . I 'll give you a hand , Miss Claythorne . "
43446	43450	43443	43443	Vera	129	" Thank you . "
43514	43523	43511	43511	She	74	" It 's like a bee a bumblebee . "
43713	43721	43709	43710	Vera Claythorne	129	" Shall I go and fetch her ? "
43726	43731	43722	43722	Blore	89	" Just a minute . "
43747	43783	43744	43744	He	89	" Look here , everybody , my opinion 's this : we need n't look farther for the author of these deaths than the diningroom at this minute . I 'd take my oath that woman 's
43790	43790	43744	43744	He	89	"
43794	43799	43791	43791	Armstrong	81	" And the motive ? "
43800	43811	43812	43812	Armstrong	81	" Religious mania . What do you say , doctor ? "
43815	43837	43812	43812	Armstrong	81	" It 's perfectly possible . I 've nothing to say against it . But of course we 've no proof . "
43841	43857	43838	43838	Vera	129	" She was very odd in the kitchen when we were getting breakfast . Her eyes "
43864	43884	43861	43861	Lombard	69	" You ca n't judge her by that . We 're all a bit off our heads by now ! "
43888	43920	43885	43885	Blore	89	" There 's another thing . She 's the only one who would n't give an explanation after that gramophone record . Why ? Because she had n't any to give . "
43930	43942	43927	43927	She	129	" That 's not quite true . She told me afterwards . "
43946	43956	43943	43943	Wargrave	53	" What did she tell you , Miss Claythorne ? "
43970	44015	43965	43967	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" A perfectly straightforward story . I personally should have no difficulty in accepting it . Tell me , Miss Claythorne , did she appear to be troubled by a sense of guilt or a feeling of remorse for her attitude in the matter ? "
44016	44020	44022	44022	Vera	129	" None whatever , "
44024	44030	44022	44022	Vera	129	" She was completely unmoved . "
44034	44049	44031	44031	Blore	89	" Hearts as hard as flints , these righteous spinsters ! Envy , mostly ! "
44055	44076	44050	44052	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" It is now five minutes to eleven . I think we should summon Miss Brent to join our conclave . "
44080	44090	44077	44077	Blore	89	" Are n't you going to take any action ? "
44095	44142	44091	44092	The judge	375	" I fail to see what action we can take . Our suspicions are , at the moment , only suspicions . I will , however , ask Dr. Armstrong to observe Miss Brent 's demeanour very carefully . Let us now go into the diningroom . "
44199	44207	44196	44196	Blore	89	" My God , she 's dead ! "
44219	44228	44214	44216	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" One more of us acquitted too late ! "
44255	44273	44251	44251	Lombard	69	" How did she die , doctor ? She was all right when we left her here ! "
44293	44303	44290	44290	He	81	" That 's the mark of a hypodermic syringe . "
44316	44330	44313	44313	Vera	129	" Look a bee a bumblebee . Remember what I said this morning ! "
44335	44352	44331	44331	Armstrong	81	" It was n't that bee that stung her ! A human hand held the syringe . "
44357	44363	44353	44354	The judge	375	" What poison was injected ? "
44367	44395	44364	44364	Armstrong	81	" At a guess , one of the cyanides . Probably Potassium Cyanide , same as Anthony Marston . She must have died almost immediately by asphyxiation . "
44399	44410	44396	44396	Vera	129	" But that bee ? It ca n't be coincidence ? "
44415	44437	44411	44411	Lombard	69	" Oh , no , it is n't coincidence ! It 's our murderer 's touch of local colour ! He 's a

44496	44508	44492	44492	He	69	" It 's mad ! absolutely mad we 're all mad ! "
44514	44537	44509	44510	The judge	375	" We have still , I hope , our reasoning powers . Did any one bring a hypodermic syringe to this house ? "
44555	44561	44542	44542	himself	81	" Yes , I did . "
44585	44595	44582	44582	He	81	" Always travel with one . Most doctors do . "
44602	44619	44596	44598	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Quite so . Will you tell us , doctor , where that syringe is now ? "
44620	44628	44673	44674	IV Armstrong	81	" In the suitcase in my room . "
44632	44642	44629	44629	Wargrave	53	" We might , perhaps , verify that fact . "
44678	44685	44673	44674	IV Armstrong	81	" Somebody must have taken it ! "
44727	44738	44716	44716	He	81	" I tell you some one must have taken it . "
44753	44787	44749	44750	The judge	375	" There are five of us here in this room . One of us is a murderer . The position is fraught with grave danger . Everything must be done in order to safeguard the

44867	44901	44863	44864	The judge	375	" I have , myself , some sleeping tablets sulphonal , I think they are . I presume they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given . You , Mr. Lombard ,
44909	44909	44863	44864	The judge	375	"
44915	44921	44910	44911	Philip Lombard	69	" What if I have ? "
44922	44954	44910	44911	Philip Lombard	69	" Only this . I propose that the doctor 's supply of drugs , my own sulphonal tablets , your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms should be

44992	45004	44989	44989	Lombard	94	" I 'm damned if I 'll give up my revolver ! "
45009	45101	45005	45005	Wargrave	53	" Mr. Lombard , you are a very strongly built and powerful young man , but ex Inspector Blore is also a man of powerful physique . I do not know what the outcome of a struggle between you would be but I can tell you this . On Blore 's side , assisting him to the best of our ability will be myself , Dr. Armstrong and Miss Claythorne . You will appreciate , therefore , that the odds against you if you choose to resist will be somewhat heavy . "
45118	45134	45108	45108	His	94	" Oh , very well then . Since you 've got it all taped out . "
45142	45157	45139	45139	his	53	" You are a sensible young man . Where is this revolver of yours ? "
45158	45169	45108	45108	His	94	" In the drawer of the table by my bed . "
45172	45178	45139	45139	his	53	" I 'll fetch it . "
45179	45192	45193	45193	Philip	69	" I think it would be desirable if we went with you . "
45205	45213	45193	45193	Philip	69	" Suspicious devil , are n't you ? "
45252	45255	45257	45257	Lombard	94	" Satisfied ? "
45327	45362	45363	45363	Vera	129	" I hope you will understand . Miss Claythorne , that we can make no exceptions . That revolver must be found . You have , I presume , a bathing dress with you ? "
45366	45386	45322	45323	the judge	375	" Then I will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us
45389	45389	45322	45323	the judge	375	"
45419	45439	45415	45415	Wargrave	53	" Thank you , Miss Claythorne . Now if you will remain here , we will search your room . "
45470	45532	45466	45467	The judge	375	" We are now assured of one thing . There are no lethal weapons or drugs in the possession of any of us five . That is one point to the good . We will now place the drugs in a safe place . There is , I think , a silver chest , is there not , in the pantry ? "
45536	45556	45533	45533	Blore	166	" That 's all very well , but who 's to have the key ? You , I suppose . "
45657	45694	45654	45654	He	375	" You two are the strongest physically . It would be difficult for either of you to get the key from the other . It would be impossible for any of us three to do so . To
45728	45728	45729	45729	He	375	"
45736	45756	45729	45729	He	375	" We are still faced by one very grave problem . What has become of Mr. Lombard 's revolver ? "
45760	45775	45757	45757	Blore	166	" Seems to me its owner is the most likely person to know that . "
45789	45805	45786	45786	He	375	" You damned pigheaded fool ! I tell you it 's been stolen from me ! "
45809	45817	45806	45806	Wargrave	53	" When did you see it last ? "
45818	45838	45757	45757	Blore	166	" Last night . It was in the drawer when I went to bed ready in case anything happened . "
45846	45869	45843	45843	He	375	" It must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for Rogers or after his dead body was discovered . "
45873	45889	45870	45870	Vera	129	" It must be hidden somewhere about the house . We must look for it . "
45903	45937	45900	45900	He	53	" I doubt if our search will result in anything . Our murderer has had plenty of time to devise a hidingplace . I do not fancy we shall find that revolver easily . "
45942	45969	45938	45938	Blore	166	" I do n't know where the revolver is , but I 'll bet I know where something else is that hypodermic syringe . Follow me . "
46016	46049	46009	46009	Blore	166	" Only place it could be . After he 'd killed her , he opened the window and threw out the syringe and picked up the china figure from the table and followed on
46053	46053	46009	46009	Blore	166	"
46075	46084	46068	46068	Vera	129	" Now let us look for the revolver . "
46090	46119	46085	46087	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" By all means . But in doing so let us be careful to keep together . Remember , if we separate , the murderer gets his chance . "
46142	46155	46171	46172	Five people	1386	" One of us ... One of us ... One of us ... "
46489	46521	46479	46479	he	81	" We we should n't just sit here doing nothing ! There must be something surely , surely , there is something that we can do ? If we lit a bonfire "
46526	46531	46522	46522	Blore	89	" In this weather ? "
46600	46626	46597	46597	Lombard	69	" It 's only a question of time . The weather will clear . Then we can do something signallight fires make a raft something ! "
46636	46655	46627	46627	Armstrong	81	" A question of time time ? We ca n't afford time ! We shall all be dead ... "
46672	46685	46662	46662	his	53	" Not if we are careful . We must be very careful ... "
46785	46845	46847	46847	I	0	" It 's Armstrong ... I saw him looking at me sideways just then ... his eyes are mad ... quite mad ... Perhaps he is n't a doctor at all ... That 's it , of course ! ... He 's a lunatic , escaped from some doctor 's house pretending to be a doctor ... It 's true ...

47056	47092	47049	47049	I	0	" Twenty to four ... only twenty to four ... perhaps the clock has stopped ... I do n't understand no , I do n't understand ... This sort of thing ca n't happen ... it is

47160	47219	47221	47221	him	1410	" I must keep my head ... I must keep my head ... If only I keep my head ... It 's all perfectly clear all worked out . But nobody must suspect . It may do the trick . It must ! Which one ? That 's the question which one ? I think yes , I rather think

47236	47243	47233	47233	Vera	129	" Does any one want tea ? "
47254	47261	47251	47251	Blore	89	" I 'd like a cup . "
47268	47282	47265	47265	She	129	" I 'll go and make it . You can all stay here . "
47289	47310	47283	47285	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" I think , my dear young lady , we would all prefer to come and watch you make it . "
47325	47332	47322	47322	She	129	" Of course ! You would ! "
47377	47384	47369	47370	The judge	375	" We must be very careful ... "
47417	47439	47414	47414	He	69	" Of course ! The engine 's not been run today since Rogers has n't been there to see to it . "
47445	47458	47440	47440	He	69	" We could go out and get it going , I suppose . "
47464	47482	47483	47483	Lombard	69	" There are packets of candles in the larder , I saw them , better use those . "
47720	47732	47776	47776	Hugo	66	" Can I swim out to the island , Miss Claythorne ? "
47733	47745	47776	47776	Hugo	66	" Why ca n't I swim out to the island ? ... "
47822	47829	47830	47831	Vera Claythorne	129	" Do n't be a fool , "
47835	47865	47830	47831	Vera Claythorne	129	" It 's all right . The others are downstairs . All four of them . There 's no one in the room . There ca n't be . You 're
47872	47872	47869	47870	my girl	2640	"
48013	48018	48007	48007	men	789	" What the devil ? "
48019	48024	48007	48007	men	789	" What 's happened ? "
48025	48033	48007	48007	men	789	" Good God , what is it ? "
48077	48085	48060	48061	some one	637	" My God , look at that ! "
48176	48190	48173	48173	She	129	" It was seaweed only seaweed and that 's what the smell was ... "
48283	48290	48279	48279	She	129	" Where did this come from ? "
48306	48313	48303	48303	He	89	" I got it from downstairs . "
48317	48324	48314	48314	Vera	176	" I wo n't drink it ... "
48341	48379	48336	48336	He	69	" Good for you , Vera ! You 've got your wits about you even if you have been scared half out of your life . I 'll get a fresh bottle that has n't been opened . "
48389	48402	48385	48385	Vera	176	" I 'm all right now . I 'll have some water . "
48444	48451	48440	48440	Blore	89	" That brandy 's all right . "
48455	48461	48452	48452	Armstrong	81	" How do you know ? "
48466	48486	48462	48462	Blore	89	" I did n't put anything in it . That 's what you 're getting at , I suppose . "
48490	48518	48487	48487	Armstrong	81	" I 'm not saying you did . You might have done it , or some one might have tampered with the bottle for just this emergency . "
48551	48563	48564	48564	He	69	" There you are , my girl . Absolutely no deception . "
48575	48593	48564	48564	He	69	" Lucky there 's a good supply of spirits in the house . Thoughtful of U.N. Owen . "
48613	48630	48610	48610	He	69	" You 'd better drink this , Miss Claythorne . You 've had a nasty shock . "
48654	48669	48647	48648	Philip Lombard	69	" Well , here 's one murder that has n't gone according to plan ! "
48677	48686	48670	48670	Vera	129	" You think that was what was meant ? "
48690	48710	48670	48670	Vera	129	" Expected you to pass out through fright ! Some people would have , would n't they , doctor ? "
48721	48741	48717	48717	He	81	" H'm , impossible to say . Young healthy subject no cardiac weakness . Unlikely . On the other hand "
48775	48782	48771	48771	He	81	" H'm , tastes all right . "
48791	48810	48788	48788	He	89	" If you 're saying that I tampered with that , I 'll knock your ruddy block off . "
48826	48832	48811	48811	Vera	129	" Where 's the judge ? "
48841	48853	48833	48835	The three men	966	" That 's odd ... Thought he came up with us . "
48857	48876	48854	48854	Blore	89	" So did I ... What about it , doctor ? You came up the stairs behind me . "
48880	48908	48877	48877	Armstrong	81	" I thought he was following me ... Of course , he 'd be bound to go slower than we did . He 's an old man . "
48919	48925	48916	48916	Lombard	69	" It 's damned odd ... "
48929	48936	48926	48926	Blore	89	" We must look for him . "
48963	48974	48957	48957	Armstrong	81	" Of course he may have stayed in the livingroom ... "
48985	48994	48980	48980	Armstrong	81	" Wargrave , Wargrave , where are you ? "
49207	49213	49194	49194	He	81	" He 's been shot ... "
49217	49222	49214	49214	Blore	89	" God the revolver ! "
49234	49243	49223	49224	The doctor	310	" Got him through the head . Instantaneous . "
49260	49268	49254	49254	her	129	" Miss Brent 's missing grey wool ... "
49272	49284	49269	49269	Blore	89	" And the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroom ... "
49288	49298	49285	49285	Vera	129	" So this is what they wanted them for ... "
49309	49362	49269	49269	Blore	89	" Five little Indian boys going in for law ; one got in Chancery and then there were four . ' That 's the end of Mr. Bloody Justice Wargrave . No more pronouncing sentence for him ! No more putting on of the black cap ! Here 's the last time he 'll
49396	49396	49392	49392	he	122	"
49408	49419	49405	49405	Vera	129	" Only this morning you said he was the one ! "
49434	49460	49427	49427	He	69	" I know I did ... Well , I was wrong . Here 's one more of us who 's been proved innocent too late ! "
49501	49508	49497	49497	Blore	89	" What do we do now ? "
49513	49528	49509	49509	Lombard	69	" Have something to eat . We 've got to eat , you know . "
49556	49564	49553	49553	Vera	129	" I shall never eat tongue again . "
49584	49597	49581	49581	Blore	89	" Only four of us now ... Who 'll be the next ? "
49607	49613	49601	49601	He	81	" We must be very careful "
49620	49633	49601	49601	He	81	" That 's what he said ... And now he 's dead ! "
49637	49646	49634	49634	Armstrong	81	" How did it happen , I wonder ? "
49653	49684	49650	49650	He	69	" A damned clever double cross ! That stuff was planted in Miss Claythorne 's room and it worked just as it was intended to . Every one dashes up there thinking
49705	49705	49695	49696	some one	637	"
49709	49719	49706	49706	Blore	89	" Why did n't any one hear the shot ? "
49725	49739	49722	49722	his	69	" Miss Claythorne was screaming , the wind was howling , we were running about
49752	49756	49793	49793	his	89	" He paused . "
49777	49777	49767	49767	He	1474	"
49781	49786	49778	49778	Blore	89	" He probably will . "
49806	49818	49803	49803	Armstrong	81	" Four of us , and we do n't know which ... "
49822	49826	49819	49819	Blore	89	" I know ... "
49830	49838	49827	49827	Vera	129	" I have n't the least doubt ... "
49843	49851	49839	49839	Armstrong	81	" I suppose I do know really ... "
49856	49868	49852	49853	Philip Lombard	69	" I think I 've got a pretty good idea now ... "
49886	49902	49883	49883	She	129	" I feel awful . I must go to bed ... I 'm dead beat . "
49906	49918	49903	49903	Lombard	69	" Might as well . No good sitting watching each other . "
49922	49928	49919	49919	Blore	89	" I 've no objection ... "
49933	49949	49929	49930	The doctor	310	" The best thing to do although I doubt if any of us will sleep . "
49959	49969	49956	49956	Blore	89	" I wonder where that revolver is now ? ... "
50096	50108	50090	50090	He	69	" Yes , this business has got you rattled all right . "
50201	50224	50194	50194	She	129	" You 're all right until morning . Nothing happened last night . Nothing will happen tonight . Nothing can happen . You 're
50237	50237	50230	50231	No one	2286	"
50243	50282	50239	50239	she	129	" Of course ! I can stay here ! Stay here locked in ! Food does n't really matter ! I can stay here safely till help comes ! Even if it 's a day or two days ... "
50338	50360	50329	50336	Horrid whiny little boy , always pestering her	1491	" Miss Claythorne , why ca n't I swim out to the rock ? I can . I know I can . "
50369	50383	50363	50363	her	129	" Of course you can , Cyril , really . I know that . "
50384	50393	50363	50363	her	129	" Can I go then , Miss Claythorne ? "
50394	50433	50363	50363	her	129	" Well , you see , Cyril , your mother gets so nervous about you . I 'll tell you what . Tomorrow you can swim out to the rock . I 'll talk to your mother on the beach
50466	50466	50449	50449	you	1493	"
50467	50482	50363	50363	her	129	" Oh , good egg , Miss Claythorne ! That will be a lark ! "
50534	50546	50530	50530	he	67	" Miss Claythorne said I could ... Well , what of it ?
50563	50565	50557	50557	she	1492	" How can
50584	50620	50577	50577	I	0	" They 'd believe her all right . Cyril often told stories . He was an untruthful child . Cyril would know , of course . But that did n't matter ... And anyway nothing would go
50912	50922	50903	50903	Blore	89	" What was it the old geezer had said ? "
50923	50930	50931	50934	Selfrighteous smug old hypocrite	180	" We must be very careful ... "
52133	52138	52173	52173	he	89	" Who 's there ? "
52139	52158	52159	52159	He	89	" It 's Blore . I do n't think Armstrong is in his room . Wait a minute . "
52177	52184	52173	52173	he	89	" Miss Claythorne . Miss Claythorne . "
52194	52204	52185	52185	Vera	129	" Who is it ? What 's the matter ? "
52205	52223	52224	52224	He	89	" It 's all right , Miss Claythorne . Wait a minute . I 'll come back . "
52279	52287	52275	52275	He	69	" What the hell 's all this ? "
52298	52308	52309	52309	He	69	" Armstrong eh ? So he 's our pigeon ! "
52317	52331	52332	52332	He	69	" Sorry , Blore , but I do n't take anything on trust . "
52339	52343	52332	52332	He	69	" Armstrong Armstrong . "
52373	52384	52370	52370	He	69	" Key 's not in the door on the inside . "
52388	52403	52385	52385	Blore	89	" That means he locked it on the outside and took it with him . "
52407	52432	52404	52404	Philip	69	" Ordinary precaution to take . We 'll get him , Blore ... This time , we 'll get him ! Half a second . "
52441	52444	52433	52433	He	69	" Vera . "
52445	52448	52404	52404	Philip	69	" Yes . "
52449	52474	52433	52433	He	69	" We 're hunting Armstrong . He 's out of his room . Whatever you do , do n't open your door . Understand ? "
52475	52481	52404	52404	Philip	69	" Yes , I understand . "
52482	52520	52433	52433	He	69	" If Armstrong comes along and says that I 've been killed , or Blore 's been killed , pay no attention . See ? Only open your door if both Blore and I speak to you . Got
52523	52523	52433	52433	He	69	"
52527	52537	52524	52524	Vera	129	" Yes . I 'm not a complete fool . "
52541	52544	52538	52538	Lombard	69	" Good . "
52552	52563	52549	52549	He	69	" And now after him ! The hunt 's up ! "
52567	52582	52564	52564	Blore	89	" We 'd better be careful . He 's got a revolver , remember . "
52594	52602	52603	52603	He	69	" That 's where you 're wrong . "
52611	52624	52603	52603	He	69	" Latch pushed back so that he could get in again easily . "
52629	52636	52637	52637	He	69	" I 've got that revolver ! "
52649	52659	52646	52646	he	69	" Found it put back in my drawer tonight . "
52680	52714	52676	52676	He	69	" Do n't be a damned fool , Blore ! I 'm not going to shoot you ! Go back and barricade yourself in if you like ! I 'm off after Armstrong . "
52738	52750	52733	52733	He	89	" I suppose I 'm asking for it . But after all "
53233	53240	53228	53228	Lombard	69	" Vera ? You all right ? "
53241	53248	53228	53228	Lombard	69	" Yes . What 's happened ? "
53254	53261	53249	53249	Blore	89	" Will you let us in ? "
53310	53315	53306	53306	She	100	" What 's happened ? "
53319	53324	53316	53316	Lombard	69	" Armstrong 's disappeared ... "
53329	53332	53325	53326	VII Vera	183	" What ? "
53336	53343	53333	53333	Lombard	69	" Vanished clean off the island . "
53347	53360	53344	53344	Blore	89	" Vanished that 's the word ! Like some damned conjuring trick . "
53365	53373	53361	53361	Vera	183	" Nonsense ! He 's hiding somewhere ! "
53377	53425	53374	53374	Blore	89	" No , he is n't ! I tell you , there 's nowhere to hide on this island . It 's as bare as your hand ! There 's moonlight outside . As clear as day it is . And he s not to be found . "
53429	53437	53426	53426	Vera	183	" He doubled back into the house . "
53441	53477	53438	53438	Blore	89	" We thought of that . We 've searched the house too . You must have heard us . He 's not here , I tell you . He 's gone clean vanished , vamoosed ... "
53482	53489	53478	53478	Vera	183	" I do n't believe it . "
53493	53501	53490	53490	Lombard	69	" It 's true , my dear . "
53508	53537	53502	53502	He	69	" There 's one other little fact . A pane in the diningroom window has been smashed and there are only three little Indian boys on the table . "
53641	53657	53638	53638	Lombard	69	" We 'll try heliographing today with a mirror from the highest point of the island .
53704	53704	53692	53692	they	1571	"
53708	53731	53705	53705	Vera	183	" Surely some one can read Morse . And then they 'll come to take us off . Long before this evening . "
53735	53771	53732	53732	Lombard	69	" The weather 's cleared all right , but the sea has n't gone down yet . Terrific swell on ! They wo n't be able to get a boat near the island before tomorrow . "
53775	53782	53772	53772	Vera	183	" Another night in this place ! "
53788	53817	53785	53785	his	69	" May as well face it ! Twentyfour hours will do it , I think . If we can last out that , we 'll be all right . "
53826	53842	53843	53843	Lombard	69	" We 'd better come to a clear understanding . What 's happened to Armstrong ? "
53846	53877	53843	53843	Lombard	69	" Well , we 've got one piece of evidence . Only three little Indian boys left on the dinnertable . It looks as though Armstrong had got his quietus . "
53881	53892	53878	53878	Vera	183	" Then why have n't you found his dead body ? "
53896	53899	53893	53893	Blore	89	" Exactly . "
53908	53918	53905	53905	He	69	" It 's damned odd no getting over it . "
53923	53933	53919	53919	Blore	89	" It might have been thrown into the sea . "
53938	53959	53919	53919	Blore	89	" By whom ? You ? Me ? You saw him go out of the front door . You come along and
53990	53990	53974	53975	the devil	2032	"
53994	54007	53991	53991	Blore	89	" I do n't know . But I do know one thing . "
54011	54016	54008	54008	Lombard	69	" What 's that ? "
54020	54052	54017	54017	Blore	89	" The revolver . It was your revolver . It 's in your possession now . There 's nothing to show that it has n't been in your possession all along . "
54053	54064	54017	54017	Blore	89	" Come now , Blore , we were all searched . "
54065	54085	54017	54017	Blore	89	" Yes , you 'd hidden it away before that happened . Afterwards you just took it back again . "
54086	54118	54017	54017	Blore	89	" My good blockhead , I swear to you that it was put back in my drawer . Greatest surprise I ever had in my life when I found it there . "
54122	54151	54119	54119	Blore	89	" You ask us to believe a thing like that ! Why the devil should Armstrong , or any one else for that matter , put it back ? "
54158	54185	54152	54152	Lombard	69	" I have n't the least idea . It 's just crazy . The last thing one would expect . There seems no point in it . "
54189	54205	54186	54186	Blore	89	" No , there is n't . You might have thought of a better story . "
54206	54220	54287	54287	Blore	89	" Rather proof that I 'm telling the truth , is n't it ? "
54221	54231	54186	54186	Blore	89	" I do n't look at it that way . "
54235	54240	54232	54232	Philip	69	" You would n't . "
54244	54261	54241	54241	Blore	89	" Look here , Mr. Lombard , if you 're an honest man , as you pretend "
54265	54286	54262	54262	Philip	69	" When did I lay claims to being an honest man ? No , indeed , I never said that . "
54292	54328	54287	54287	Blore	89	" If you 're speaking the truth there 's only one thing to be done . As long as you have that revolver , Miss Claythorne and I are at your mercy . The only fair thing
54353	54353	54354	54355	Philip Lombard	69	"
54368	54375	54365	54365	he	69	" Do n't be an ass . "
54376	54384	54365	54365	he	69	" You wo n't agree to that ? "
54385	54411	54365	54365	he	69	" No , I wo n't . That revolver 's mine . I need it to defend myself and I 'm going to keep it . "
54415	54428	54412	54412	Blore	89	" In that case we 're bound to come to one conclusion . "
54429	54475	54365	54365	he	69	" That I 'm U.N. Owen ? Think what you damned well please . But I 'll ask you , if that 's so , why I did n't pot you with the revolver last night ? I could have , about twenty times over . "
54484	54502	54481	54481	He	89	" I do n't know and that 's a fact . You must have had some reason . "
54518	54531	54512	54512	She	129	" I think you 're both behaving like a pair of idiots . "
54537	54542	54532	54532	Lombard	94	" What 's this ? "
54546	54564	54543	54543	Vera	129	" You 've forgotten the nursery rhyme . Do n't you see there 's a clue there ? "
54572	54581	54565	54565	She	129	" Four little Indian boys going out to sea ;
54593	54593	54582	54584	A red herring	1576	"
54598	54633	54594	54594	She	129	" A red herring that 's the vital clue . Armstrong 's not dead ... He took away the china Indian to make you think he was . You may say what you like Armstrong 's
54650	54650	54639	54639	His	1578	"
54659	54668	54656	54656	He	94	" You know , you may be right . "
54672	54693	54669	54669	Blore	89	" Yes , but if so , where is he ? We 've searched the place . Outside and inside . "
54698	54724	54694	54694	Vera	129	" We all searched for the revolver , did n't we , and could n't find it ? But it was somewhere all the time ! "
54728	54747	54748	54748	Vera	129	" There 's a slight difference in size , my dear , between a man and a revolver . "
54751	54763	54748	54748	Vera	129	" I do n't care I 'm sure I 'm right . "
54767	54796	54764	54764	Blore	89	" Rather giving himself away , was n't it ? Actually mentioning a red herring in the verse . He could have written it up a bit different . "
54800	54838	54797	54797	Vera	129	" But do n't you see , he 's mad ? It 's all mad ! The whole thing of going by the rhyme is mad ! Dressing up the judge , killing Rogers when he was chopping sticks
54874	54874	54859	54861	some horrible child	1581	"
54878	54885	54875	54875	Blore	89	" Yes , you 're right . "
54891	54914	54875	54875	Blore	89	" At any rate there 's no Zoo on the island . He 'll have a bit of trouble getting over that . "
54918	54944	54915	54915	Vera	129	" Do n't you see ? We 're the Zoo ... Last night , we were hardly human any more . We 're the Zoo ... "
55050	55072	55037	55037	She	129	" One feels safer here , out in the open ... Do n't let 's go back into the house again . "
55076	55103	55073	55073	Lombard	94	" Not a bad idea . We 're pretty safe here , no one can get at us without our seeing him a long time beforehand . "
55107	55113	55104	55104	Vera	129	" We 'll stay here . "
55117	55136	55137	55137	Vera	129	" Have to pass the night somewhere . We 'll have to go back to the house then . "
55140	55155	55137	55137	Vera	129	" I ca n't bear it . I ca n't go through another night ! "
55159	55170	55156	55156	Philip	69	" You 'll be safe enough locked in your room . "
55174	55179	55171	55171	Vera	129	" I suppose so . "
55188	55198	55180	55180	She	129	" It 's lovely to feel the sun again ... "
55202	55245	55199	55199	She	129	" How odd ... I 'm almost happy . And yet I suppose I 'm actually in danger ... Somehow now nothing seems to matter ... not in daylight ... I feel full of power I feel that I ca n't die ... "
55256	55266	55253	55253	He	89	" It 's two o'clock . What about lunch ? "
55271	55291	55267	55267	Vera	129	" I 'm not going back to the house . I 'm going to stay here in the open . "
55292	55311	55267	55267	Vera	129	" Oh , come now , Miss Claythorne . Got to keep your strength up , you know . "
55315	55351	55312	55312	Vera	129	" If I even see a tinned tongue , I shall be sick ! I do n't want any food . People go days on end with nothing sometimes when they 're on a diet . "
55355	55371	55312	55312	Vera	129	" Well , I need my meals regular . What about you , Mr. Lombard ? "
55375	55398	55372	55372	Philip	69	" You know , I do n't relish the idea of tinned tongue particularly . I 'll stay here with Miss Claythorne . "
55405	55437	55402	55402	Vera	129	" I shall be quite all right . I do n't think he 'll shoot me as soon as your back is turned if that 's what you 're afraid of . "
55441	55460	55402	55402	Vera	129	" It 's all right if you say so . But we agreed we ought not to separate . "
55464	55488	55402	55402	Vera	129	" You 're the one who wants to go into the lion 's den . I 'll come with you if you like ? "
55489	55496	55498	55498	Blore	89	" No , you wo n't , "
55500	55506	55498	55498	Blore	89	" You 'll stay here . "
55510	55533	55507	55507	Philip	69	" So you 're still afraid of me ? Why , I could shoot you both this very minute if I liked . "
55537	55568	55507	55507	Philip	69	" Yes , but that would n't be according to plan . It 's one at a time , and it 's got to be done in a certain way . "
55569	55572	55574	55574	Philip	69	" Well , "
55576	55585	55574	55574	Philip	69	" you seem to know all about it . "
55586	55590	55592	55592	Blore	89	" Of course , "
55594	55606	55592	55592	Blore	89	" it 's a bit jumpy going up to the house alone "
55611	55640	55607	55607	Philip	69	" And therefore , will I lend you my revolver ? Answer , no , I will not ! Not quite so simple as that , thank you . "
55663	55679	55659	55659	Lombard	69	" Feeding time at the Zoo ! The animals are very regular in their habits ! "
55684	55696	55680	55680	Vera	129	" Is n't it very risky , what he 's doing ? "
55697	55737	55680	55680	Vera	129	" In a sense you mean no , I do n't think it is ! Armstrong 's not armed , you know , and anyway Blore is twice a match for him in physique and he 's very much on his
55762	55762	55755	55755	I	0	"
55763	55771	55680	55680	Vera	129	" But what other solution is there ? "
55776	55781	55772	55772	Philip	69	" There 's Blore . "
55782	55789	55755	55755	I	0	" Oh do you really think ? "
55790	55828	55772	55772	Philip	69	" Listen , my girl . You heard Blore 's story . You 've got to admit that if it 's true , I ca n't possibly have had anything to do with Armstrong 's disappearance . His story
55885	55885	55877	55877	Armstrong	81	"
55886	55889	55890	55890	Lombard	69	" How ? "
55895	55963	55892	55892	his	69	" That we do n't know . But if you ask me , we 've only one danger to fear and that danger is Blore ! What do we know about the man ? Less than nothing ! All this expoliceman story may be bunkum ! He may be anybody a mad millionaire a crazy business man an escaped inmate of Broadmoor . One thing 's certain . He
55973	55973	55892	55892	his	69	"
55988	55995	55980	55980	She	129	" And supposing he gets us ? "
56007	56020	55996	55996	Lombard	69	" I 'm going to take very good care he does n't . "
56028	56048	56049	56049	Vera	129	" Touching faith in me , have n't you , Vera ? Quite sure I would n't shoot you ? "
56052	56081	56049	56049	Vera	129	" One has got to trust some one ... As a matter of fact I think you 're wrong about Blore . I still think it 's Armstrong . "
56088	56108	56082	56082	She	129	" Do n't you feel all the time that there 's some one . Some one watching and waiting ? "
56113	56119	56109	56109	Lombard	69	" That 's just nerves . "
56124	56131	56120	56120	Vera	129	" Then you have felt it ? "
56141	56148	56149	56149	She	129	" Tell me you do n't think "
56156	56177	56149	56149	She	129	" I read a story once about two judges that came to a small American town from the Supreme Court . They
56194	56194	56197	56197	his	69	"
56203	56225	56200	56200	He	69	" Heavenly visitants , eh ? No , I do n't believe in the supernatural . This business is human enough . "
56233	56240	56226	56226	Vera	129	" Sometimes I 'm not sure ... "
56249	56254	56260	56260	he	69	" That 's conscience ... "
56265	56275	56260	56260	he	69	" So you did drown that kid after all ? "
56280	56297	56276	56276	Vera	129	" I did n't ! I did n't ! You 've no right to say that ! "
56302	56336	56370	56370	Lombard	69	" Oh , yes , you did , my good girl ! I do n't know why . Ca n't imagine . There was a man in it probably . Was that it ? "
56360	56369	56353	56353	She	129	" Yes there was a man in it ... "
56374	56385	56370	56370	Lombard	69	" Thanks . That 's what I wanted to know ... "
56394	56405	56391	56391	She	129	" What was that ? It was n't an earthquake ? "
56409	56437	56406	56406	Lombard	69	" No , no . Queer , though a thud shook the ground . And I thought did you hear a sort of cry ? I did . "
56448	56462	56445	56445	Lombard	69	" It came from there . We 'd better go up and see . "
56463	56473	56445	56445	Lombard	69	" No , no , I 'm not going . "
56474	56481	56445	56445	Lombard	69	" Please yourself . I am . "
56486	56496	56482	56482	Vera	129	" All right . I 'll come with you . "
56576	56584	56573	56573	He	69	" Whose is that window just above ? "
56593	56617	56585	56585	Vera	129	" It 's mine and that 's the clock from my mantelpiece ... I remember now . It was shaped like a bear . "
56627	56635	56618	56618	She	129	" It was shaped like a bear ... "
56653	56674	56646	56646	his	69	" This settles it . Armstrong is in hiding somewhere in that house . I 'm going to get him . "
56684	56714	56681	56681	She	129	" Do n't be a fool . It 's us now ! We 're next ! He wants us to look for him ! He 's counting on it ! "
56722	56729	56718	56718	He	69	" There 's something in that . "
56733	56746	56730	56730	Vera	129	" At any rate , you do admit now I was right . "
56750	56780	56718	56718	He	69	" Yes you win ! It 's Armstrong all right . But where the devil did he hide himself ? We went over the place with a finetooth comb . "
56785	56806	56781	56781	Vera	129	" If you did n't find him last night , you wo n't find him now ... That 's commonsense . "
56811	56815	56807	56807	Lombard	69	" Yes , but "
56816	56849	56871	56872	Philip Lombard	69	" He must have prepared a secret place beforehand naturally of course it 's just what he would do . You know , like a Priest 's Hole in old manor houses . "
56850	56861	56807	56807	Lombard	69	" This is n't an old house of that kind . "
56862	56870	56871	56872	Philip Lombard	69	" He could have had one made . "
56880	56899	56877	56877	He	69	" We measured the place that first morning . I 'll swear there 's no space unaccounted for . "
56903	56908	56900	56900	Vera	129	" There must be ... "
56912	56918	56909	56909	Lombard	69	" I 'd like to see "
56922	56944	56919	56919	Vera	129	" Yes , you 'd like to see ! And he knows that ! He 's in there waiting for you . "
56957	56966	56945	56945	Lombard	69	" I 've got this , you know . "
56967	57003	56919	56919	Vera	129	" You said Blore was all right that he was more than a match for Armstrong . So he was physically , and he was on the lookout too . But what you do n't seem to
57034	57034	57022	57022	He	2112	"
57047	57053	57044	57044	He	69	" Come on , then . "
57060	57071	57054	57055	IV Lombard	186	" What are we going to do when night comes ? "
57082	57090	57077	57077	He	69	" You have n't thought of that ? "
57095	57110	57091	57091	She	129	" What can we do ? Oh , my God , I 'm frightened ... "
57116	57155	57111	57112	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's fine weather . There will be a moon . We must find a place up by the top cliffs perhaps . We can sit there and wait for morning . We must n't go to sleep ...
57176	57176	57177	57177	He	0	"
57180	57193	57177	57177	He	0	" You 'll be cold , perhaps , in that thin dress ? "
57201	57213	57194	57194	Vera	129	" Cold ? I should be colder if I were dead ! "
57219	57226	57214	57215	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes , that 's true ... "
57234	57251	57231	57231	She	129	" I shall go mad if I sit here any longer . Let 's move about . "
57252	57256	57214	57215	Philip Lombard	69	" All right . "
57307	57316	57297	57297	Vera	129	" Pity we ca n't have a bathe ... "
57329	57351	57325	57325	He	69	" What 's that , there ? You see by that big rock ? No a little further to the right . "
57358	57366	57355	57355	She	129	" It looks like somebody 's clothes ! "
57367	57373	57374	57374	Lombard	69	" A bather , eh ? "
57377	57387	57374	57374	Lombard	69	" Queer . I suppose it 's only seaweed . "
57391	57398	57388	57388	Vera	129	" Let 's go and look . "
57399	57404	57407	57407	Lombard	69	" It is clothes , "
57413	57433	57407	57407	Lombard	69	" A bundle of them . That 's a boot . Come on , let 's scramble along here . "
57447	57457	57444	57444	She	129	" It 's not clothes it 's a man ... "
57502	57510	57499	57499	Lombard	69	" My God ! It 's Armstrong ... "
57584	57595	57581	57581	He	69	" So that 's it , is it , Vera ? "
57599	57615	57596	57596	Vera	129	" There 's no one on the island no one at all except us two ... "
57627	57641	57624	57624	Lombard	187	" Precisely . So we know where we are , do n't we ? "
57645	57657	57642	57642	Vera	129	" How was it worked that trick with the marble bear ? "
57663	57675	57716	57716	his	187	" A conjuring trick , my dear a very good one ... "
57684	57711	57681	57681	Vera	129	" Why did I never see his face properly before . A wolf that 's what it is a wolf ' face ... Those horrible teeth ... "
57724	57747	57716	57716	his	187	" This is the end , you understand . We 've come to the truth now . And it 's the end ... "
57752	57756	57748	57748	Vera	129	" I understand ... "
57786	57792	57781	57781	He	78	" This is the end ... "
57833	57838	57830	57830	She	129	" Poor Dr. Armstrong ... "
57845	57853	57842	57842	He	187	" What 's this ? Womanly pity ? "
57857	57867	57854	57854	Vera	129	" Why not ? Have n't you any pity ? "
57871	57884	57868	57868	He	187	" I 've no pity for you . Do n't expect it ! "
57896	57909	57893	57893	She	129	" We must move him . Carry him up to the house . "
57910	57938	57893	57893	She	129	" To join the other victims , I suppose ? All neat and tidy . As far as I 'm concerned he can stay where he is . "
57942	57958	57939	57939	Vera	129	" At any rate , let 's get him out of reach of the sea . "
57965	57970	57962	57962	He	187	" If you like . "
57998	58005	57995	57995	Lombard	187	" Not such an easy job . "
58029	58032	58022	58022	Lombard	187	" Satisfied ? "
58036	58039	58033	58033	Vera	129	" Quite . "
58086	58104	58083	58083	Lombard	187	" So that 's the reason for your womanly solicitude ! You wanted to pick my pocket . "
58145	58152	58141	58141	He	187	" Give that revolver to me . "
58159	58167	58156	58156	Lombard	69	" Come on , hand it over . "
58210	58222	58204	58204	He	69	" Now look here , my dear girl , you just listen "
58583	58592	58580	58580	Vera	129	" The whole thing might be a dream ... "
58669	58688	58666	58666	Vera	129	" Ordinarily one would n't care to sleep where there 's a dead body in practically every bedroom ! "
58744	58754	58741	58741	She	129	" You 're behind the times , my dears . "
58796	58814	58793	58793	She	129	" You can come with me . We 've won , my dear ! We 've won ! "
58850	58859	58910	58910	Vera	129	" One little Indian boy left all alone . "
58869	58879	58880	58880	Married	191	" He got married and then there were none . "
58915	58935	58910	58910	Vera	129	" Do n't be a fool . You 're so tired that you 're imagining the most fantastic things ... "
59010	59035	59002	59002	Hugo	66	" One little Indian boy left all alone ... What was the last line again ? Something about being married or was it something else ?
59121	59132	59133	59136	The little china figure	1641	" He went and hanged himself and then there were none ...
59181	59191	59228	59228	She	129	" You can go to the rock , Cyril ... "
59269	59277	59255	59258	Epilogue Sir Thomas Legge	192	" But the whole thing 's incredible ! "
59283	59289	59278	59279	Inspector Maine	193	" I know , sir . "
59295	59316	59317	59318	Inspector Maine	193	" Ten people dead on an island and not a living soul on it . It does n't make sense ! "
59322	59330	59317	59318	Inspector Maine	193	" Nevertheless , it happened , sir . "
59336	59349	59331	59333	Sir Thomas Legge	192	" Damn it all , Maine , somebody must have killed 'em . "
59350	59359	59290	59291	The A.C.	1646	" That 's just our problem , sir . "
59360	59369	59331	59333	Sir Thomas Legge	192	" Nothing helpful in the doctor 's report ? "
59370	59401	59290	59291	The A.C.	1646	" No , sir . Wargrave and Lombard were shot , the first through the head , the second through the heart . Miss Brent and Marston died of cyanide poisoning ,
59450	59450	59445	59446	Vera Claythorne	129	"
59458	59465	59455	59455	He	192	" Nasty business all of it . "
59478	59508	59474	59474	He	192	" Do you mean to say that you have n't been able to get anything helpful out of the Sticklehaven people . Dash it , they must know something . "
59515	59544	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" They 're ordinary decent seafaring folk . They know that the island was bought by a man called Owen and that 's about all they do know . "
59545	59557	59592	59593	The A.C.	194	" Who provisioned the island and made all the necessary arrangements ? "
59558	59566	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Man called Morris . Isaac Morris . "
59567	59577	59592	59593	The A.C.	194	" And what does he say about it all ? "
59578	59591	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" He ca n't say anything , sir , he 's dead . "
59596	59605	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Do we know anything abut this Morris ? "
59606	59681	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Oh , yes , sir , we know about him . He was n't a very savoury gentleman , Mr. Morris . He was implicated in that sharepushing fraud of Bennito 's three years ago we 're sure of that though we ca n't prove it . And he was mixed up in the dope business . And again we ca n't prove it . He was a very careful man , Morris . "
59682	59691	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" And he was behind this island business ? "
59692	59720	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Yes , sir , he put through the sale though he made it clear that he was buying Indian Island for a third party , unnamed . "
59721	59737	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Surely there 's something to be found out on the financial angle , there ? "
59742	59773	59509	59510	Inspector Maine	193	" Not if you knew Morris ! He can wangle figures until the best chartered accountant in the country would n't know if he was on his head or his heels !
59797	59797	59788	59788	he	1649	"
59808	59838	59803	59804	Inspector Maine	193	" It was Morris who made all the arrangements down at Sticklehaven , Represented himself as acting for ' Mr. Owen . ' And it was he who explained to the
59878	59878	59913	59913	He	193	"
59888	59907	59885	59885	He	192	" And you 're telling me that those people did n't smell a rat ? Not even then ? "
59916	59947	59913	59913	He	193	" You 're forgetting , sir , that Indian Island previously belonged to young Elmer Robson , the American . He had the most extraordinary parties down there . I 've no
60000	60000	60001	60003	The Assistant Commissioner	1655	"
60015	60047	60012	60012	Maine	193	" Fred Narracott that 's the man who took the party out there did say one thing that was illuminating . He said he was surprised to see what sort of people these
60100	60100	60092	60092	he	98	"
60101	60111	60061	60061	I	0	" When did he and the other men go ? "
60112	60162	60092	60092	he	98	" The signals were seen by a party of boy scouts on the morning of the 11th . There was no possibility of getting out there that day . The men got there on the afternoon of the 12th at the first moment possible to run a boat ashore there .
60190	60190	60061	60061	I	0	"
60191	60200	60061	60061	I	0	" Could n't some one have swum ashore ? "
60201	60243	60061	60061	I	0	" It 's over a mile to the coast and there were heavy seas and big breakers inshore . And there were a lot of people , boy scouts and others on the cliffs looking out towards the island and watching . "
60251	60275	60248	60248	He	1646	" What about the gramophone record you found in the house ? Could n't you get hold of anything there that might help ? "
60280	60321	60276	60277	Inspector Maine	193	" I 've been into that . It was supplied by a firm that do a lot of theatrical stuff and film effects . It was sent to U.N. Owen , Esq . c / o Isaac Morris , and was understood
60345	60345	60360	60361	Inspector Maine	193	"
60349	60359	60346	60346	Legge	192	" And what about the subject matter , eh ? "
60365	60374	60360	60361	Inspector Maine	193	" I 'm coming to that , sir . "
60380	60391	60377	60377	his	193	" I 've investigated those accusations as thoroughly as I can .
60392	60424	60377	60377	his	193	" Starting with the Rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island . They were in service with a Miss Brady who died suddenly . Ca n't get anything definite out
60483	60501	60434	60434	they	1665	" Then there is Mr. Justice Wargrave . That 's O.K. He was the judge who sentenced Seton .
60502	60531	60434	60434	they	1665	" By the way , Seton was guilty unmistakably guilty . Evidence turned up later after he was hanged which proved that beyond any shadow of doubt . But there
60561	60598	60633	60634	the A.C.	1646	" The Claythorne girl , I find , was governess in a family where a death occurred by drowning . However , she does n't seem to have had anything to do with it , and as a
60626	60626	60633	60634	the A.C.	1646	"
60627	60631	60633	60634	the A.C.	1646	" Go on , "
60645	60674	60639	60639	Maine	193	" Dr. Armstrong now . Wellknown man . Had a consulting room in Harley Street . Absolutely straight and aboveboard in his profession . Have n't been able to trace
60761	60804	60729	60729	he	1671	" Then there 's Miss Emily Brent . Girl , Beatrice Taylor , was in service with her . Got pregnant , was turned out by her mistress and went and drowned herself . Not a nice business but again not criminal . "
60805	60808	60810	60811	the A.C.	1646	" That , "
60813	60832	60810	60811	the A.C.	1646	" seems to be the point . U.N. Owen dealt with cases that the law could n't touch . "
60841	60871	60810	60811	the A.C.	1646	" Young Marston was a fairly reckless car driver had his license endorsed twice and he ought to have been prohibited from driving , in my opinion . That 's all
60914	60987	60998	60999	the A.C.	1646	" Ca n't find anything definite about General Macarthur . Fine record war service all the rest of it . Arthur Richmond was serving under him in France and was killed in action . No friction of any kind between him and the General . They were close friends , as a matter of fact . There were some blunders made about that time commanding officers sacrificed men unnecessarily possibly this was a blunder
60992	60992	60998	60999	the A.C.	1646	"
60993	60996	60998	60999	the A.C.	1646	" Possibly , "
61000	61015	60998	60999	the A.C.	1646	" Now , Philip Lombard . Lombard has been mixed up in some very curious shows
61055	61062	61063	61063	Maine	193	" Then we come to Blore . "
61066	61076	61077	61079	The other man	1538	" He of course was one of our lot . "
61082	61085	61087	61089	the Assistant Commissioner	1655	" Blore , "
61092	61098	61087	61089	the Assistant Commissioner	1655	" was a bad hat ! "
61099	61106	61107	61108	The A.C.	1646	" You think so , sir ? "
61111	61130	61107	61108	The A.C.	1646	" I always thought so . But he was clever enough to get away with it . It 's my
61199	61199	61193	61194	The man	586	"
61211	61226	61206	61208	Sir Thomas Legge	192	" And Isaac Morris is dead , you say ? When did he die ? "
61227	61262	61323	61323	He	193	" I thought you 'd soon come to that , sir . Isaac Morris died on the night of August 8th . Took an overdose of sleeping stuff one of the barbiturates , I understand .
61276	61276	61323	61323	He	193	"
61281	61291	61277	61277	Legge	192	" Care to know what I think , Maine ? "
61292	61300	61323	61323	He	193	" Perhaps I can guess , sir . "
61305	61318	61301	61301	Legge	192	" That death of Morris ' is a damned sight too opportune ! "
61326	61336	61323	61323	He	193	" I thought you 'd say that , sir . "
61355	61388	61351	61351	He	1655	" The whole thing 's fantastic impossible . Ten people killed on a bare rock of an island and we do n't know who did it , or why , or how . "
61395	61435	61392	61392	He	193	" Well , it 's not quite like that , sir . We do know why , more or less . Some fanatic with a bee in his bonnet about justice . He was out to get people who were beyond
61456	61456	61442	61442	He	1688	"
61465	61474	61461	61461	He	1690	" Does n't it ? It seems to me "
61491	61495	61496	61496	he	192	" Carry on , "
61499	61536	61496	61496	he	192	" Just for a minute I felt I 'd got somewhere . Got , as it were , the clue to the thing . It 's gone now . Go ahead with what you were saying . "
61541	61558	61537	61537	Maine	193	" There were ten people to be executed , let 's say . They were executed . U.N.
61578	61578	61568	61568	he	1688	"
61583	61600	61601	61601	Maine	193	" Firstclass vanishing trick . But you know , Maine , there must be an explanation . "
61604	61661	61601	61601	Maine	193	" You 're thinking , sir , that if the man was n't on the island , he couldn'l have left the island , and according to the account of the interested parties he never was on the island . Well , then the only explanation possible is that he was actually one of the ten . "
61670	61710	61666	61666	Maine	193	" We thought of that , sir . We went into it . Now , to begin with , we 're not quite in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island . Vera Claythorne kept a diary , so
61805	61837	61787	61787	Blore	89	" Now , sir , it seemed to me , taking everything into account , that we might find here a perfectly good solution . Armstrong was drowned , you remember . Granting
61875	61937	61953	61953	he	81	" That was a good solution but it wo n't do . No , sir , it wo n't do . First of all there 's the police surgeon 's evidence . He got to the island early on the morning of August 13th . He could n't say much to help us . All he could say was that all the people
62076	62108	62171	62171	He	81	" You might say , I suppose that Armstrong managed to polish off the other three before he went into the sea that night . But there 's another point and one you
62150	62170	62171	62171	He	81	" So that settles one point definitely . Some one was alive on the island after Armstrong was dead . "
62178	62212	62171	62171	He	81	" And that leaves just what exactly ? Here 's the position early on the morning of the 11th . Armstrong has ' disappeared ' ( drowned ) . That leaves us three people .
62277	62277	62278	62279	The A.C.	194	"
62283	62287	62278	62279	The A.C.	194	" Whose window ? "
62288	62322	62323	62323	he	69	" Vera Claythorne 's . Now , sir , let 's take each of these cases separately . First Philip Lombard . Let 's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto Blore then
62344	62380	62278	62279	The A.C.	194	" But if so , woo took away the revolver from him ? For that revolver was found up in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs Wargrave 's room . "
62385	62391	62381	62382	The A.C.	194	" Any fingerprints on it ? "
62392	62401	62278	62279	The A.C.	194	" Yes , sir , Vera Claythorne 's . "
62402	62409	62381	62382	The A.C.	194	" But , man alive , then "
62410	62445	62278	62279	The A.C.	194	" I know what you 're going to say , sir . That it was Vera Claythorne . That she shot Lombard , took the revolver back to the house , toppled the marble block onto
62452	62473	62381	62382	The A.C.	194	" And that 's quite all right up to a point . There 's a chair in her bedroom and on the
62509	62545	62381	62382	The A.C.	194	" But that chair was n't found kicked over . It was , like , all the other chairs , neatly put back against the wall . That was done after Vera Claythorne 's death by some
62549	62578	62585	62585	himself	89	" That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard and inducing Vera Claythorne to hang herself he then went out and pulled down a
62645	62645	62628	62628	he	89	"
62651	62655	62646	62648	The Assistant Commissioner	1655	" I agree . "
62660	62695	62656	62657	Inspector Maine	193	" And therefore , sir , there must have been some one else on the island . Some one who tidied up when the whole business was over . But where was he all the time
62728	62728	62729	62729	He	193	"
62737	62741	62732	62734	The Assistant Commissioner	1655	" In that case "
62754	62760	62761	62761	he	193	" But in that case , "
62764	62769	62761	62761	he	193	" who killed them ? "
64192	64221	64222	64222	He	1774	" You 're right . Murder is n't what most people think giving some one a dollop of arsenic pushing them over a cliff that sort of stuff . "
64235	64265	64232	64232	He	1774	" I 've known a murderess known her , I tell you . And what 's more I was crazy about her ... God help me , sometimes I think I
64351	64351	64342	64343	a woman	2223	"
64357	64366	64352	64352	I	0	" Are you sure she did do it ? "
64380	64426	64367	64367	He	0	" I 'm quite sure . Nobody else ever thought of it . But I knew the moment I looked at her when I got back after ... And she knew I knew ... What she did n't realize was that I loved that kid ... "
65825	65832	65814	65814	he	81	" A red herring swallowed one ... "
66662	66665	66639	66640	the murderer	1180	" red herring "
