3504	3614	3615	3615	You	0	" Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials . As a man of means from South Africa , Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society unchallenged . Indian Island . He remembered Indian Island as a boy ... Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls stood about a mile from the coast . It had got its name from its resemblance to a man 's head an American Indian profile . Funny idea to go and build a house on it ! Awful in bad weather ! But millionaires were full of whims !

3845	3881	3882	3882	Jim	87	" But there , as it happens , he was wrong ... Outside Oakbridge station a little group of people stood in momentary uncertainty . Behind them stood porters with suitcases . One of these called "

3946	3998	3927	3928	The driver	324	" There are two taxis here , sir . One of them must wait till the slow train from Exeter gets in a matter of five minutes there 's one gentleman coming by that . Perhaps one of you would n't mind waiting ? You 'd be more comfortable that way . "

4172	4177	4168	4169	Miss Brent	74	" Yes , indeed . "
4215	4226	4210	4212	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4227	4248	4249	4250	The judge	336	" have been to Cornwall and to Torquay , but this is my first visit to this part of Devon . "
4253	4264	4249	4250	The judge	336	" also am unacquainted with this part of the world . "
4278	4288	4270	4275	The driver of the second taxi	338	" Like to sit inside while you 're waiting ? "
4293	4298	4289	4289	Vera	121	" Not at all . "
4306	4323	4303	4303	He	70	" That sunny wall looks more attractive . Unless you 'd rather go inside the station ? "
4324	4341	4342	4342	He	70	" No , indeed . It 's so delightful to get out of that stuffy train . "
4345	4358	4359	4359	Vera	121	" Yes , travelling by train is rather trying in this weather . "
4363	4380	4359	4359	Vera	121	" do hope it lasts the weather , mean . Our English summers are so treacherous . "
4390	4401	4387	4387	Lombard	69	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4402	4412	4413	4413	She	121	" No , I 've never been here before . "
4427	4436	4413	4413	She	121	" have n't even seen my employer yet . "

4453	4458	4461	4461	his	70	" Oh , see . "
4477	4484	4474	4474	He	70	" Is n't that rather unusual ? "
4488	4519	4485	4485	Vera	121	" Oh , no , do n't think so . Her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she wired to an agency for a substitute and they sent me . "
4520	4540	4541	4541	Vera	121	" So that was it . And suppose you do n't like the post when you 've got there ? "
4545	4603	4604	4604	Lombard	69	" Oh , it 's only temporary a holiday post . I 've got a permanent job at a girls ' school . As a matter of fact I 'm frightfully thrilled at the prospect of seeing Indian Island . There 's been such a lot about it in the papers . Is it really very fascinating ? "
4607	4617	4604	4604	Lombard	69	" do n't know . have n't seen it . "
4618	4642	4643	4643	Lombard	69	" Oh , really ? The Owens are frightfully keen on it , suppose . What are they like ? Do tell me . "
4646	4659	4643	4643	Lombard	69	" Awkward , this am supposed to have met them or not ? "
4664	4679	4660	4660	He	69	" There 's a wasp crawling up your arm . No keep quite still . "
4686	4693	4680	4680	He	69	" There . It 's gone ! "
4694	4710	4765	4777	a tall soldierly old man who appeared at the exit from the platform	340	" Oh , thank you . There are a lot of wasps about this summer . "
4711	4730	4680	4680	He	69	" Yes , suppose it 's the heat . Who are we waiting for , do you know ? "
4731	4738	4680	4680	He	69	" have n't the least idea . "
4754	4762	4751	4751	Lombard	69	" That will be the train now . "
4824	4838	4821	4821	She	121	" am Mrs. Owen 's secretary . There is a car here waiting . "
4842	4848	4839	4839	She	121	" This is Mr. Lombard . "
4882	4894	4895	4898	The three of them	344	" Goodlooking fellow . Something just a little wrong about him ... "
4946	4971	4942	4943	General Macarthur	77	" Do n't know this part of Devon at all . My little place is in East Devon just on the borderline of Dorset . "
4975	4996	4972	4972	Vera	121	" It really is lovely here . The hills and the red earth and everything so green and luscious looking . "
5002	5023	4997	4998	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's a bit shut in ... like open country myself . Where you can see what 's coming ... "
5030	5042	5024	5025	General Macarthur	77	" You 've seen a bit of the world , fancy ? "
5049	5060	5045	5045	his	69	" I 've knocked about here and there , sir . "
5066	5088	5061	5061	He	77	" He 'll ask me now if was old enough to be in the War . These old boys always do . "
5158	5166	5153	5153	Vera	121	" It 's a long way out . "
5264	5274	5275	5275	he	364	" Thought we might as well wait for you , "
5278	5308	5309	5309	He	364	" Make one trip of it . Allow me to introduce myself . Name 's Davis . Natal , South Africa 's my natal spot , ha , ha ! "
5350	5362	5364	5365	Mr. Davis	93	" Any one care for a little nip before we embark ? "
5383	5400	5401	5401	he	93	" Must n't delay , then . Our good host and hostess will be expecting us , "
5501	5549	5493	5493	He	1881	" Will you be ready to be starting for the island , ladies and gentlemen ? The boat 's waiting . There 's two gentlemen coming by car , but Mr. Owen 's orders was not to wait for them as they might arrive at any time . "
5577	5585	5573	5574	Emily Brent	74	" That 's a very small boat . "
5593	5616	5573	5574	Emily Brent	74	" She 's a fine boat , that , Ma'am . You could go to Plymouth in her as easy as winking . "
5623	5632	5617	5619	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" There are a good many of us . "
5633	5643	5644	5645	Philip Lombard	69	" She 'd take double the number , sir . "
5653	5665	5648	5648	his	69	" It 's quite all right . Glorious weather no swell . "
6385	6396	6380	6381	Philip Lombard	69	" Must be difficult to land here in dirty weather . "
6402	6426	6397	6398	Fred Narracott	95	" Ca n't land on Indian Island when there 's a southeasterly . Sometimes ' tis cut off for a week or more . "
6431	6455	6427	6428	Vera Claythorne	121	" The catering must be very difficult . That 's the worst of an island . All the domestic problems are so worrying . "
6505	6511	6501	6502	General Macarthur	77	" Ha , delightful spot ! "
6603	6612	6600	6600	He	455	" Will you come this way , please ? "
6689	6723	6683	6685	the butler chap	459	" Mr. Owen unfortunately delayed unable to get here till tomorrow . Instructions everything they wanted if they would like to go to their rooms ? ... dinner would be at 8 o'clock ... "
6780	6791	6775	6776	Mrs. Rogers	89	" hope you 've got everything you want , Miss ? "
6828	6835	6824	6824	She	121	" Yes , everything , think . "
6836	6849	6850	6851	Mrs. Rogers	89	" You 'll ring the bell if you want anything , Miss ? "
6906	6915	6903	6903	Vera	121	" She looks frightened of her own shadow . "
6956	6970	6952	6952	She	121	" I 'm Mrs. Owen 's new secretary . expect you know that . "
6975	7001	6971	6972	Mrs. Rogers	89	" No , Miss , do n't know anything . Just a list of the ladies and gentlemen and what rooms they were to have . "
7005	7013	7002	7002	Vera	121	" Mrs. Owen did n't mention me ? "
7020	7037	7014	7015	Mrs. Rogers	89	" have n't seen Mrs. Owen not yet . We only came here two days ago . "
7038	7045	7047	7047	Vera	121	" Extraordinary people , these Owens , "
7053	7060	7050	7050	she	121	" What staff is there here ? "
7061	7068	7069	7069	Vera	121	" Just me and Rogers , Miss. "
7097	7128	7093	7094	Mrs. Rogers	89	" I 'm a good cook and Rogers is handy about the house . did n't know , of course , that there was to be such a large party . "
7132	7138	7129	7129	Vera	121	" But you can manage ? "
7139	7166	7167	7167	Vera	121	" Oh , yes , Miss , can manage . If there 's to be large parties often perhaps Mrs. Owen could get extra help in . "
7170	7174	7167	7167	Vera	121	" expect so . "
7256	7271	7272	7272	She	121	" wish I 'd seen the Owens ... wish knew what they were like . "
7858	7893	7855	7855	He	80	" All the same , this evening , I 'll imagine to myself that I 'm not going back that I 've done with London and Harley Street and all the rest of it . "
7937	7947	7934	7934	He	80	" I 'm leaving my ordinary life behind me . "
8122	8153	8115	8117	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Armstrong ? Remember him in the witness box . Very correct and cautious . All doctors are damned fools . Harley Street ones are the worst of the lot . "
8179	8186	8176	8176	he	53	" Drinks are in the hall . "
8191	8204	8187	8188	Dr. Armstrong	80	" must go and pay my respects to my host and hostess . "
8220	8227	8209	8209	his	53	" You ca n't do that . "
8233	8237	8238	8239	The judge	336	" Why not ? "
8242	8260	8238	8239	The judge	336	" No host and hostess . Very curious state of affairs . Do n't understand this place . "
8286	8292	8282	8282	Wargrave	53	" D'you know Constance Culmington ? "
8293	8303	8313	8314	the judge	336	" Er no , I 'm afraid do n't . "
8304	8311	8313	8314	the judge	336	" It 's of no consequence , "
8316	8337	8313	8314	the judge	336	" Very vague woman and practically unreadable handwriting . was just wondering if I 'd come to the wrong house . "
8441	8452	8436	8437	the Judge	336	" Is Lady Constance Culmington expected , do you know ? "
8458	8468	8453	8453	Rogers	89	" No , sir , not to my knowledge . "
8483	8497	8476	8476	he	336	" Indian Island , eh ? There 's a nigger in the woodpile . "
8545	8554	8540	8540	He	87	" Must go through with it , suppose , "
8666	8704	8663	8663	He	88	" Remember this island when was a kid . Never thought I 'd be doing this sort of a job in a house here . Good thing , perhaps , that one ca n't foresee the future ... "
8889	8945	8884	8884	she	556	" The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken . The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . The wicked shall be turned into hell . "
9116	9126	9111	9112	Anthony Marston	87	" Quaint , these things , are n't they ? "
9147	9150	9152	9152	Tony	85	" Indians . "
9154	9164	9165	9165	Vera	121	" Indian Island . suppose that 's the idea . "
9169	9179	9165	9165	Vera	121	" wonder . How many are there ? Ten ? "
9180	9186	9187	9187	Vera	121	" Yes ten there are . "
9190	9222	9187	9187	Vera	121	" What fun ! They 're the ten little Indian boys of the nursery rhyme , suppose . In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece . "
9226	9233	9223	9223	Lombard	69	" In my room , too . "
9234	9238	9284	9285	Vera Claythorne	121	" And mine . "
9239	9243	9244	9244	Everybody	257	" And mine . "
9252	9263	9249	9249	Vera	121	" It 's an amusing idea , is n't it ? "
9269	9273	9264	9266	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Remarkably childish , "
9330	9334	9326	9327	Emily Brent	74	" Pleasant sound . "
9339	9343	9335	9335	Vera	121	" hate it . "
9363	9377	9357	9357	She	121	" do n't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm . "
9382	9395	9396	9396	she	74	" I 've no doubt the house is shut up in winter , "
9399	9412	9413	9413	Vera	121	" You 'd never get servants to stay here for one thing . "
9416	9426	9413	9413	Vera	121	" It must be difficult to get servants anyway . "
9431	9449	9427	9428	Emily Brent	74	" Mrs. Oliver has been lucky to get these two . The woman 's a good cook . "
9453	9463	9464	9464	She	121	" Funny how elderly people always get names wrong . "
9467	9479	9464	9464	She	121	" Yes , think Mrs. Owen has been very lucky indeed . "
9512	9520	9508	9508	She	121	" Owen ? Did you say Owen ? "
9521	9524	9525	9526	Emily Brent	74	" Yes . "
9530	9543	9525	9526	Emily Brent	74	" I 've never met any one called Owen in my life . "
9547	9550	9551	9551	She	121	" But surely "

10176	10181	10171	10171	Lombard	69	" Get some brandy . "
10194	10199	10182	10182	Rogers	89	" Yes , sir , "
10212	10226	10208	10208	Vera	121	" Who was that speaking ? Where was he ? It sounded it sounded "
10232	10248	10227	10228	General Macarthur	77	" What 's going on here ? What kind of a practical joke was that ? "
10377	10391	10374	10374	He	80	" That voice ? It sounded as though it were in the room . "
10395	10411	10392	10392	Vera	121	" Who was it ? Who was it ? It was n't one of us . "
10493	10500	10490	10490	He	69	" Ah , here we are . "
10600	10608	10609	10609	Vera	121	" You are charged with the following indictments "
10612	10625	10609	10609	Vera	121	" Turn it off ! Turn it off ! It 's horrible ! "
10639	10649	10629	10630	Dr. Armstrong	80	" A disgraceful and heartless practical joke , suppose . "
10660	10672	10655	10657	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" So you think it 's a joke , do you ? "
10679	10686	10673	10674	The doctor	285	" What else could it be ? "
10701	10714	10698	10698	He	69	" At the moment I 'm not prepared to give an opinion . "
10723	10747	10720	10720	He	87	" Look here , there 's one thing you 've forgotten . Who the devil turned the thing on and set it going ? "
10751	10761	10762	10762	He	53	" Yes , think we must inquire into that . "
10806	10836	10799	10799	Rogers	89	" Allow me , Madam , I 'll speak to her . Ethel Ethel it 's all right . All right , do you hear ? Pull yourself together . "
10870	10877	10866	10866	Rogers	89	" Pull yourself together , Ethel . "
10885	10901	10902	10902	She	89	" You 'll be all right now , Mrs. Rogers . Just a nasty turn . "
10905	10911	10902	10902	She	89	" Did faint , sir ? "
10912	10915	10866	10866	Rogers	89	" Yes . "
10916	10927	10928	10928	Her	89	" It was The Voice that awful voice like a judgement "
10943	10949	10938	10939	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Where 's that brandy ? "
10977	10984	10968	10968	he	285	" Drink this , Mrs. Rogers . "
11010	11024	11007	11007	She	89	" I 'm all right now . It just gave me a turn . "
11029	11060	11025	11025	Rogers	89	" Of course it did . It gave me a turn too . Fair made me drop that tray . Wicked lies , it was ! I 'd like to know "
11102	11117	11099	11099	he	53	" Who put that record on the gramophone ? Was it you , Rogers ? "
11121	11150	11118	11118	Rogers	89	" did n't know what it was . Before God , did n't know what it was , sir . If had I 'd never have done it . "
11156	11171	11151	11152	The judge	336	" That is probably true . But think you 'd better explain , Rogers . "
11185	11197	11181	11181	He	455	" was just obeying orders , sir , that 's all . "
11198	11202	11151	11152	The judge	336	" Whose orders ? "
11203	11208	11209	11211	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Mr. Owen 's . "
11214	11230	11209	11211	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Let me get this quite clear . Mr. Owen 's orders were what exactly ? "
11234	11272	11273	11274	The judge	336	" was to put a record on the gramophone . I 'd find the record in the drawer and my wife was to start the gramophone when I 'd gone into the drawingroom with the coffee tray . "
11277	11282	11283	11283	Rogers	89	" Avery remarkable story . "
11286	11327	11283	11283	Rogers	89	" It 's the truth , sir . swear to God it 's the truth . did n't know what it was not for moment . It had a name on it thought it was just a piece of music . "
11333	11341	11342	11342	Lombard	69	" Was there a title on it ? "
11358	11370	11355	11355	He	69	" Quite right , sir . It was entitled Swan Song ... "
11380	11407	11377	11377	He	77	" The whole thing is preposterous preposterous ! Slinging accusations about like this ! Something must be done about it . This fellow Owen whoever he is "
11416	11426	11412	11412	She	74	" That 's just it , who is he ? "
11449	11481	11446	11446	He	336	" That is exactly what we must go into very carefully . should suggest that you get your wife to bed first of all , Rogers . Then come back here . "
11482	11487	11488	11489	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Yes , sir . "
11492	11502	11488	11489	Dr. Armstrong	80	" I 'll give you a hand , Rogers . "
11525	11541	11521	11522	Tony Marston	85	" Do n't know about you , sir , but could do with a drink . "
11545	11548	11542	11542	Lombard	69	" agree . "
11552	11559	11560	11560	He	85	" I 'll go and forage . "
11575	11590	11567	11567	He	85	" Found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought in . "
11647	11653	11654	11654	he	80	" She 's all right , "
11657	11679	11654	11654	he	80	" I 've given her a sedative to take . What 's that , a drink ? could do with one . "
11720	11741	11716	11717	The judge	336	" Now then , Rogers , we must get to the bottom of this . Who is this Mr. Owen ? "
11745	11753	11742	11742	Rogers	89	" He owns this place , sir . "
11754	11776	11777	11777	Rogers	89	" am aware of that fact . What want you to tell me is what you yourself know about the man . "
11782	11798	11779	11779	his	626	" ca n't say , sir . You see , I 've never seen him . "
11812	11823	11808	11809	General Macarthur	77	" You 've never seen him ? What d'yer mean ? "
11824	11857	11858	11858	Blore	88	" We 've only been here just under a week , sir , my wife and I. We were engaged by letter , through an agency . The Regina Agency in Plymouth . "
11861	11866	11867	11867	he	88	" Old established firm , "
11873	11880	11870	11870	Wargrave	53	" Have you got that letter ? "
11881	11896	11808	11809	General Macarthur	77	" The letter engaging us ? No , sir . did n't keep it . "
11897	11915	11808	11809	General Macarthur	77	" Go on with your story . You were engaged , as you say , by letter . "
11916	11955	11870	11870	Wargrave	53	" Yes , sir . We were to arrive on a certain day . We did . Everything was in order here . Plenty of food in stock and everything very nice . Just needed dusting and that . "
11956	11960	11808	11809	General Macarthur	77	" What next ? "
11961	12024	12025	12026	The judge	336	" Nothing , sir . We got orders by letter again to prepare the rooms for a houseparty and then yesterday by the afternoon post got another letter from Mr. Owen . It said he and Mrs. Owen were detained and to do the best we could and it gave the instructions about dinner and coffee and putting on the gramophone record . "
12030	12038	12025	12026	The judge	336	" Surely you 've got that letter ? "
12039	12050	12051	12051	He	336	" Yes , sir , I 've got it here . "
12063	12066	12067	12067	he	336	" H'm , "
12070	12077	12067	12067	he	336	" Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten . "
12090	12101	12087	12087	He	88	" If you 'll just let me have a look . "
12122	12156	12119	12119	He	88	" Coronation machine . Quite new no defects . Ensign paper the most widely used make . You wo n't get anything out of that . Might be fingerprints , but doubt it . "
12179	12198	12176	12176	He	87	" Got some fancy Christian names , has n't he ? Ulick Norman Owen . Quite a mouthful . "
12199	12209	12173	12173	his	87	" The old judge said with a slight start : "
12230	12250	12215	12216	Mr. Marston	119	" He looked round at the others and thrusting his neck forward like an angry tortoise , he said : "
12289	12297	12298	12298	We	630	" He paused and then went on . "
12323	12338	12310	12313	each one of us	635	" There was a moment 's pause and then Emily Brent spoke with decision . "
12348	12352	12310	12313	each one of us	635	" she said . "
12431	12437	12429	12429	Owen	64	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said : "
12446	12447	12443	12444	Miss Brent	74	" "
12456	12477	12443	12444	Miss Brent	74	" She went away and returned a minute later with the letter . The judge read it . He said : "
12485	12499	12482	12483	Miss Claythorne	121	" Vera explained the circumstances of her secretarial engagement . The judge said : "
12502	12506	12500	12500	Marston	119	" Anthony said : "
12544	12552	12553	12554	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Again Wargrave nodded . He said : "
12556	12557	12553	12554	Dr. Armstrong	80	" "
12563	12564	12553	12554	Dr. Armstrong	80	" "
12576	12577	12567	12567	You	639	" "
12590	12595	12580	12583	A colleague of mine	642	" The judge said : "
12616	12617	12603	12604	that colleague	643	" "
12622	12635	12603	12604	that colleague	643	" Lombard , who had been staring at Blore , said suddenly : "
12645	12652	12639	12639	I	0	" The judge lifted a hand . "
12656	12657	12603	12604	that colleague	643	" "
12659	12660	12603	12604	that colleague	643	" "
12694	12704	12691	12692	General Macarthur	77	" Pulling at his moustache , the General muttered : "
12740	12744	12745	12746	Mr. Lombard	92	" Wargrave said : "
12748	12774	12745	12746	Mr. Lombard	92	" Lombard 's brain had been active . Was he to come out in the open , or not ? He made up his mind . "
12780	12784	12745	12746	Mr. Lombard	92	" he said . "
12804	12831	12797	12797	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave turned his attention to Mr. Blore . His forefinger stroked his upper lip and his voice was dangerously polite . He said : "
12921	12926	12912	12912	you	0	" Blore said sulkily : "
12949	12950	12947	12947	Davis	93	" "
12957	12958	12953	12955	William Henry Blore	88	" "
12963	12964	12947	12947	Davis	93	" "
12969	12973	12947	12947	Davis	93	" said Lombard . "
13037	13063	13019	13019	I	0	" All eyes were turned on Blore . Angry suspicious eyes . Anthony Marston moved a step nearer to him . His fists clenched themselves . "
13070	13074	13067	13068	you swine	652	" he said . "
13078	13090	13067	13068	you swine	652	" Blore flung back his head and set his square jaw . "
13098	13102	13091	13092	You gentlemen	653	" he said . "
13133	13139	13147	13147	Owen	64	" Mr. Justice Wargrave asked : "
13143	13144	13145	13147	This man Owen	656	" "
13190	13191	13207	13208	Mrs. Owen	91	" "
13196	13201	13202	13203	Mrs. Owen	91	" Blore said bitterly : "
13221	13236	13207	13208	Mrs. Owen	91	" Again the forefinger of the judge stroked his lip , this time appreciatively . "
13245	13249	13237	13237	Your	0	" he said . "
13316	13320	13303	13304	U.N. Owen	122	" Vera cried : "
13327	13336	13276	13277	Una Nancy	64	" The judge nodded gently . He said : "
13364	13392	13356	13357	a madman	661	" There was a moment 's silence a silence of dismay and bewilderment . Then the judge 's small clear voice took up the thread once more . "
13419	13434	13473	13473	she	61	" He took a letter from his pocket and tossed it onto the table . "
13634	13642	13628	13629	General Macarthur	77	" He paused . Then he said : "
13668	13679	13661	13661	he	667	" Immediately a babel broke out . General Macarthur shouted : "
13687	13692	13661	13661	he	667	" Vera cried out : "
13697	13703	13661	13661	he	667	" Her breath came fast . "
13706	13711	13661	13661	he	667	" Rogers said hoarsely : "
13725	13730	13661	13661	he	667	" Anthony Marston growled : "
13742	13763	13661	13661	he	667	" The upraised hand of Mr. Justice Wargrave calmed the tumult . He said , picking his words with care : "
13917	13961	13983	13983	Judge	682	" Armstrong was remembering now . The Seton case ! The verdict had come as a great surprise . He had met Matthews , K.C. , on one of the days of the trial dining at a restaurant . Matthews had been confident . "
13973	13982	13983	13983	Judge	682	" And then afterwards he had heard comments : "
14012	14013	14019	14019	he	125	" "
14028	14053	14019	14019	he	125	" All these memories rushed through the doctor 's mind . Before he could consider the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsively : "
14067	14084	14055	14055	you	682	" The hooded reptilian eyes met his . In a clear cold voice the judge said : "
14094	14100	14101	14102	The fellow	683	" Armstrong said to himself : "
14110	14122	14123	14123	I	0	" Vera Claythorne spoke in a trembling voice . She said : "
14226	14243	14203	14203	she	689	" She broke down , weeping bitterly . General Macarthur patted her shoulder . He said : "
14285	14298	14322	14322	he	691	" He stood erect , squaring his shoulders . He barked out : "
14377	14413	14373	14373	Caesar	126	" General Macarthur sat down . His shaking hand pulled at his moustache . The effort to speak had cost him a good deal . Lombard spoke . His eyes were amused . He said : "
14417	14421	14373	14373	Caesar	126	" Marston said : "
14426	14431	14424	14424	them	700	" Philip Lombard grinned . "
14466	14472	14473	14473	You	703	" General Macarthur said sternly : "
14482	14486	14473	14473	You	703	" Lombard said : "
14529	14545	14546	14546	You	703	" Vera lifted her face from her hands . She said , staring at him : "
14552	14556	14546	14546	You	703	" Lombard answered : "
14562	14581	14546	14546	You	703	" His amused eyes looked into her horrified ones . Anthony Marston said in a slow puzzled voice : "
14608	14615	14595	14602	a couple of kids ran over near Cambridge	708	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said acidly : "
14623	14627	14595	14602	a couple of kids ran over near Cambridge	708	" Anthony said : "
14680	14686	14687	14688	This speeding	713	" Dr. Armstrong said warmly : "
14706	14715	14716	14716	Speed	128	" Anthony shrugged his shoulders . He said : "
14740	14777	14785	14785	my	0	" He looked round vaguely for his glass , picked it up off a table and went over to the side table and helped himself to another whiskey and soda . He said over his shoulder : "
14792	14817	14825	14825	sir	1898	" The manservant , Rogers , had been moistening his lips and twisting his hands . He said now in a low deferential voice : "
14827	14831	14825	14825	sir	1898	" Lombard said : "
14837	14853	14835	14835	Rogers	89	" Rogers cleared his throat and passed his tongue once more over his dry lips . "
14999	15038	15069	15069	Eh	728	" Lombard looked thoughtfully at the man 's twitching face , his dry lips , the fright in his eyes . He remembered the crash of the falling coffee tray . He thought , but did not say , "
15043	15057	15069	15069	Eh	728	" Blore spoke spoke in his hearty bullying official manner . He said : "
15071	15081	15069	15069	Eh	728	" Rogers drew himself up . He said stiffly : "
15105	15109	15099	15099	I	0	" Lombard said : "
15117	15118	15112	15112	yourself	0	" "
15123	15124	15121	15121	me	0	" "
15133	15138	15139	15139	Landor	107	" Blore went purple . "
15153	15162	15141	15141	you	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave stirred . He said : "
15195	15199	15184	15184	You	0	" Blore said : "
15202	15203	15184	15184	You	0	" "
15224	15228	15229	15229	He	107	" Blore said : "
15252	15257	15258	15258	You	0	" Wargrave said slowly : "
15272	15277	15258	15258	You	0	" Blore said sulkily : "
15282	15290	15294	15294	my	0	" He added in a thick voice : "
15297	15308	15294	15294	my	0	" Lombard laughed a sudden ringing laugh . He said : "
15341	15371	15372	15372	I	0	" Emily Brent glanced at him in sharp distaste and drew herself away a little . Dr. Armstrong , very much master of himself , shook his head goodhumouredly . "
15382	15386	15372	15372	I	0	" he said . "
15485	15496	15475	15475	they	738	" He sighed , shaking his head . He thought : "
15579	15625	15550	15550	she	745	" There was a silence in the room . Everybody was looking , covertly or openly , at Emily Brent . It was a minute or two before she became aware of the expectation . Her eyebrows rose on her narrow forehead . She said : "
15640	15645	15627	15627	you	746	" The judge said : "
15651	15652	15648	15649	Miss Brent	74	" "
15655	15671	15672	15672	You	74	" Her lips closed tightly . The judge stroked his face . He said mildly : "
15677	15683	15672	15672	You	74	" Miss Brent said coldly : "
15711	15751	15752	15752	Our	747	" There was an unsatisfied feeling in the air . But Emily Brent was not one to be swayed by public opinion . She sat unyielding . The judge cleared his throat once or twice . Then he said : "
15776	15777	15778	15778	Nobody	368	" "
15786	15787	15788	15788	You	1898	" "
15794	15795	15799	15799	sir	1898	" "
15801	15805	15788	15788	You	1898	" Wargrave said : "
15848	15878	15879	15879	Rogers	89	" He may be dangerous . In my opinion it would be well for us to leave this place as soon as possible . suggest that we leave tonight . "
15882	15898	15879	15879	Rogers	89	" beg your pardon , sir , but there 's no boat on the island . "
15899	15905	15879	15879	Rogers	89	" No boat at all ? "
15906	15911	15879	15879	Rogers	89	" No , sir . "
15912	15921	15879	15879	Rogers	89	" How do you communicate with the mainland ? "
15922	15950	15951	15953	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Fred Narracott , he comes over every morning , sir . He brings the bread and the milk and the post , and takes the orders . "
15956	15979	15951	15953	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Then in my opinion it would be well if we all left tomorrow morning as soon as Narracott 's boat arrives . "
16002	16009	16010	16010	he	87	" A bit unsporting , what ? "
16013	16035	16010	16010	he	87	" Ought to ferret out the mystery before we go . Whole thing 's like a detective story . Positively thrilling . "
16041	16061	16036	16037	The judge	336	" At my time of life , have no desire for ' thrills , ' as you call them . "
16068	16086	16062	16062	Anthony	87	" The legal life 's narrowing ! I 'm all for crime ! Here 's to it . "
16196	16204	16188	16188	He	80	" My God ! he 's dead ! "
16302	16315	16298	16299	General Macarthur	77	" Dead : D'you mean the fellow just choked and and died ? "
16320	16337	16338	16338	He	80	" You can call it choking if you like . He died of asphyxiation right enough . "
16375	16390	16371	16372	General Macarthur	77	" Never knew a man could die like that just of a choking fit ! "
16399	16410	16391	16392	Emily Brent	74	" In the midst of life we are in death . "
16420	16446	16416	16416	He	80	" No , a man does n't die of a mere choking fit . Marston 's death was n't what we call a natural death . "
16454	16462	16447	16447	Vera	121	" Was there something in the whiskey ? "
16466	16499	16500	16501	The judge	336	" Yes . Ca n't say exactly . Everything points to one of the cyanides . No distinctive smell of Prussic Acid , probably Potassium Cyanide . It acts pretty well instantaneously . "
16505	16512	16500	16501	The judge	336	" It was in his glass ? "
16513	16516	16517	16518	The doctor	285	" Yes . "
16553	16560	16548	16548	He	285	" They 're both all right . "
16564	16578	16561	16561	Lombard	69	" You mean he must have put the stuff in his glass himself ! "
16590	16595	16587	16587	He	285	" Seems like it . "
16599	16610	16596	16596	Blore	88	" Suicide , eh ? That 's a queer go . "
16615	16658	16611	16611	Vera	121	" You 'd never think that he would kill himself . He was so alive . He was oh enjoying himself ! When he came down the hill in his car this evening he looked he looked oh , ca n't explain ! "
16704	16713	16700	16701	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Is there any possibility other than suicide ? "
16779	16806	16775	16775	Blore	88	" You know , doctor , it does n't seem right to me . should n't have said Mr. Marston was a suicidal type of gentleman . "
16810	16813	16807	16807	Armstrong	80	" agree . "
16883	16895	16879	16880	Emily Brent	74	" We 'd better go to bed . It 's late . "
16931	16940	16927	16928	The judge	336	" Yes , we must get some sleep . "
16944	16953	16941	16941	Rogers	89	" have n't cleared yet in the diningroom . "
16958	16965	16954	16954	Lombard	69	" Do it in the morning . "
16971	16978	16966	16966	Armstrong	80	" Is your wife all right ? "
16979	16988	16989	16989	He	80	" I 'll go and see , sir . "
16997	17004	16989	16989	He	80	" Sleeping beautiful , she is . "
17005	17008	17010	17011	the doctor	285	" Good , "
17013	17019	17010	17011	the doctor	285	" Do n't disturb her . "
17020	17050	17051	17051	He	80	" No , sir . I 'll just put things straight in the diningroom and make sure everything ' locked up right , and then I 'll turn in . "
17553	17569	17548	17548	He	115	" That 's a rum go ! could have sworn there were ten of them . "
17639	17642	17632	17632	her	133	" Dull ! "
17920	17925	17918	17918	his	109	" Yes , sir . "
18113	18134	18108	18108	People	1853	" Old Macarthur lost his nerve a bit , made some colossal blunders , sacrificed some of his best men . "
18684	18693	18681	18681	He	134	" wonder when we shall get away again . "
18779	18786	18776	18776	He	134	" Peaceful sound . Peaceful place ... "
18790	18816	18787	18787	He	134	" Best of an island is once you get there you ca n't go any further ... you 've come to the end of things ... "
18865	18886	18861	18861	She	121	" Hugo ... Hugo ... Why do feel you 're so near to me tonight ? ... Somewhere quite close ... "
18911	18968	18977	18978	Miss Claythorne	121	" It was no good trying not to think of Hugo . He was close to her . She had to think of him to remember ... Cornwall ... The black rocks , the smooth yellow sand . Mrs. Hamilton , stout , goodhumoured . Cyril , whining a little always , pulling at her hand . "
18989	19007	19014	19015	Miss Claythorne	121	" Looking up meeting Hugo 's eyes watching her . The evenings after Cyril was in bed ... "
19017	19018	19014	19015	Miss Claythorne	121	" "
19023	19048	19014	19015	Miss Claythorne	121	" The decorous stroll down to the beach . The moonlight the soft Atlantic air . And then , Hugo 's arm round her . "
19062	19075	19058	19058	you	121	" Yes , she knew . ( Or thought she knew . ) "
19140	19164	19137	19138	a girl	852	" If the child has been a girl , Hugo would have come into everything . He 'd been disappointed , he admitted . "
19204	19262	19197	19197	I	0	" And he was fond of him , too . Always ready to play games or amuse his small nephew . No rancour in Hugo 's nature . Cyril was n't really strong . A puny child no stamina . The kind of child , perhaps , who would n't live to grow up ... And then ? "
19274	19279	19263	19264	Miss Claythorne	121	" Irritating whiney repetition . "
19287	19288	19285	19285	Cyril	67	" "
19294	19312	19291	19292	Miss Claythorne	121	" Vera got up . She went to the dressingtable and swallowed three aspirins . She thought : "
19320	19324	19291	19292	Miss Claythorne	121	" She thought : "
19344	19396	19331	19331	I	0	" She shuddered as she remembered Anthony Marston 's convulsed purple face . As she passed the mantelpiece , she looked up at the framed doggerel . Ten little Indian boys went out to dine ; One choked his little self and then there were nine . She thought to herself : "
19406	19655	19402	19402	us	855	" Why had Anthony Marston wanted to die ? She did n't want to die . She could n't imagine wanting to die ... Death was for the other people ... Dr. Armstrong was dreaming ... It was very hot in the operating room ... Surely they 'd got the temperature too high ? The sweat was rolling down his face . His hands were clammy . Difficult to hold the scalpel firmly ... How beautifully sharp it was ... Easy to do a murder with a knife like that . And of course he was doing a murder ... The woman 's body looked different . It had been a large unwieldy body . This was a spare meagre body . And the face was hidden . Who was it that he had to kill ? He could n't remember . But he must know ! Should he ask Sister ? Sister was watching him . No , he could n't ask her . She was suspicious , he could see that . But who was it on the operating table ? They should n't have covered up the face like that ... If he could only see the face ... Ah ! that was better . A young probationer was pulling off the handkerchief . Emily Brent , of course . It was Emily Brent that he had to kill . How malicious her eyes were ! Her lips were moving . What was she saying ? "
19666	19840	19841	19842	Doctor doctor	857	" She was laughing now . No , nurse , do n't put the handkerchief back . I 've got to see . I 've got to give the anaesthetic . Where 's the ether ? must have brought the ether with me . What have you done with the ether , Sister ? ChBteau Neuf du Pape ? Yes , that will do quite as well . Take the handkerchief away , nurse . Of course ! knew it all the time ! It 's Anthony Marston ! His face is purple and convulsed . But he 's not dead he 's laughing . tell you he 's laughing ! He 's shaking the operating table . Look out , man , look out . Nurse , steady it steady it With a start Dr. Armstrong woke up . It was morning . Sunlight was pouring into the room . And some one was leaning over him shaking him . It was Rogers . Rogers , with a white face , saying : "
19844	19861	19841	19842	Doctor doctor	857	" Dr. Armstrong woke up completely . He sat up in bed . He said sharply : "
19866	19867	19841	19842	Doctor doctor	857	" "
19902	19963	19894	19894	she	858	" Dr. Armstrong was quick and efficient . He wrapped himself in his dressinggown and followed Rogers . He bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side . He lifted the cold hand , raised the eyelid . It was some few minutes before he straightened himself and turned from the bed . Rogers whispered : "
19969	19981	19967	19967	she	858	" He passed a tongue over dry lips . Armstrong nodded . "
19988	20023	19984	19984	she	858	" His eyes rested thoughtfully on the man before him . Then they went to the table by the bed , to the washstand , then back to the sleeping woman . Rogers said : "
20035	20050	20033	20033	doctor	735	" Dr. Armstrong was a minute or two before replying . Then he said : "
20058	20062	20063	20063	She	858	" Rogers said : "
20069	20070	20071	20072	Any doctor	862	" "
20078	20079	20080	20080	Doctor	735	" "
20082	20086	20063	20063	She	858	" Rogers stared . "
20098	20099	20096	20096	us	865	" "
20112	20113	20100	20100	You	735	" "
20123	20127	20116	20116	doctor	735	" Armstrong said : "
20133	20156	20129	20129	she	858	" Now Rogers ' eyes evaded his . The man 's hands came together and turned and twisted uneasily . He muttered . "
20165	20171	20157	20157	She	858	" The doctor said sharply : "
20181	20189	20173	20173	she	858	" Rogers stared at him , surprised . "
20210	20288	20206	20206	she	858	" Armstrong went over to the washstand . There were a certain number of bottles on it . Hair lotion , lavender water , cascara , glycerine of cucumber for the hands , a mouthwash , toothpaste and some Elliman 's . Rogers helped by pulling out the drawers of the dressingtable . From there they moved on to the chest of drawers . But there was no sign of sleeping draughts or tablets . Rogers said : "
20305	20380	20206	20206	she	858	" When the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found every one up and awaiting the summons . General Macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside , exchanging desultory comments on the political situation . Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard had been up to the summit of the island behind the house . There they had discovered William Henry Blore , standing staring at the mainland . He said : "
20396	20402	20389	20389	I	0	" Vera said , smiling : "
20414	20431	20389	20389	I	0	" Philip Lombard was looking the other way , out to sea . He said abruptly : "
20439	20449	20389	20389	I	0	" Glancing up at the sky , Blore remarked : "
20456	20469	20470	20470	It	871	" Lombard pursed up his mouth into a whistle . He said : "
20482	20486	20470	20470	It	871	" Blore said : "
20490	20505	20470	20470	It	871	" From below them came the boom of a gong . Philip Lombard said : "
20515	20532	20533	20533	You	872	" As they went down the steep slope Blore said to Lombard in a ruminating voice : "
20558	20573	20549	20549	I	0	" Vera was a little ahead . Lombard hung back slightly . He said : "
20579	20580	20549	20549	I	0	" "
20599	20616	20596	20596	he	873	" Emily Brent came out of the drawingroom window to meet them . She said sharply : "
20622	20623	20596	20596	he	873	" "
20627	20676	20677	20678	That man	875	" said Vera . They went in to breakfast . There was a vast dish of eggs and bacon on the sideboard and tea and coffee . Rogers held the door open for them to pass in , then shut it from the outside . Emily Brent said : "
20684	20702	20677	20678	That man	875	" Dr. Armstrong , who was standing by the window , cleared his throat . He said : "
20738	20744	20725	20726	Mrs. Rogers	89	" Emily Brent said sharply : "
20753	20759	20725	20726	Mrs. Rogers	89	" Dr. Armstrong said easily : "
20785	20875	20901	20901	her	89	" They took the hint . Plates were filled , coffee and tea was poured . The meal began . Discussion of the island was , by mutual consent , tabooed . They spoke instead in a desultory fashion of current events . The news from abroad , events in the world of sport , the latest reappearance of the Loch Ness monster . Then , when plates were cleared , Dr. Armstrong moved back his chair a little , cleared his throat importantly and spoke . He said : "
20904	20915	20901	20901	her	89	" There were startled and shocked ejaculations . Vera exclaimed : "
20928	20945	20901	20901	her	89	" Mr. Justice Wargrave , his eyes narrowed , said in his small precise clear voice : "
20956	20962	20901	20901	her	89	" Armstrong shrugged his shoulders . "
20968	20969	20901	20901	her	89	" "
20976	20977	20901	20901	her	89	" "
20997	21001	21002	21002	She	461	" Vera said : "
21026	21032	21033	21033	Her	461	" Dr. Armstrong said drily : "
21049	21067	21033	21033	Her	461	" One word fell from Emily Brent . It fell hard and clear into the listening group . "
21070	21079	21033	21033	Her	461	" she said . Armstrong turned to her . "
21091	21103	21088	21089	Miss Brent	74	" Emily Brent , her lips tight and hard , said : "
21128	21129	21131	21131	you	883	" "
21134	21139	21131	21131	you	883	" Emily Brent said : "
21183	21191	21177	21177	She	461	" Dr. Armstrong shook his head doubtfully . "
21198	21202	21177	21177	She	461	" he said . "
21223	21229	21240	21240	God	117	" Emily Brent said quietly . "
21242	21253	21240	21240	God	117	" Every one looked shocked . Mr. Blore said uneasily : "
21265	21282	21262	21263	Miss Brent	74	" She looked at them with shining eyes . Her chin went up . She said : "
21304	21319	21320	21320	My	0	" The judge stroked his chin . He murmured in a slightly ironic voice : "
21356	21367	21410	21410	I	0	" Emily Brent shrugged her shoulders . Blore said sharply : "
21385	21389	21370	21370	she	892	" Armstrong said : "
21392	21393	21370	21370	she	892	" "
21426	21427	21428	21428	Rogers	89	" "
21436	21437	21428	21428	Rogers	89	" "
21440	21444	21428	21428	Rogers	89	" said Blore . "
21451	21469	21446	21446	he	0	" His tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply . Philip Lombard said : "
21476	21481	21473	21473	your	884	" Blore said aggressively : "
21549	21560	21539	21539	They	897	" Vera interrupted . In a low voice she said : "
21572	21581	21566	21567	Mrs. Rogers	89	" Blore looked slightly annoyed at the interruption . "
21587	21595	21584	21585	a woman	468	" his glance said . He resumed : "
21683	21818	21819	21819	Armstrong	80	" And there 's the position for you ! They 've done a murder and got away with it . But if the whole thing 's going to be raked up , what 's going to happen ? Ten to one , the woman will give the show away . She has n't got the nerve to stand up and brazen it out . She 's a living danger to her husband , that 's what she is . He 's all right . He 'll lie with a straight face till kingdom comes but he ca n't be sure of her ! And if she goes to pieces , his neck 's in danger ! So he slips something into a cup of tea and makes sure that her mouth is shut permanently . "
21823	21841	21819	21819	Armstrong	80	" There was no empty cup by her bedside there was nothing there at all . looked . "
21845	21878	21842	21842	Blore	88	" Of course there would n't be ! First thing he 'd do when she 'd drunk it would be to take that cup and saucer away and wash it up carefully . "
21890	21912	21885	21886	General Macarthur	77	" It may be so . But should hardly think it possible that a man would do that to his wife . "
21922	21943	21919	21919	He	88	" When a man 's neck 's in danger , he does n't stop to think too much about sentiment . "
21973	22012	21963	21963	He	903	" Is there anything more can get you ? I 'm sorry there was so little toast , but we 've run right out of bread . The new bread has n't come over from the mainland yet . "
22026	22037	22023	22023	He	53	" What time does the motor boat usually come over ? "
22038	22076	22077	22078	Philip Lombard	69	" Between seven and eight , sir . Sometimes it 's a bit after eight . Do n't know what Fred Narracott can be doing this morning . If he 's ill he 'd send his brother . "
22081	22088	22077	22078	Philip Lombard	69	" What 's the time now ? "
22089	22097	22098	22098	Lombard	69	" Ten minutes to ten , sir . "
22123	22140	22116	22117	General Macarthur	77	" Sorry to hear about your wife , Rogers . Doctor 's just been telling us . "
22146	22156	22157	22157	He	69	" Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . "
22181	22186	22177	22178	Philip Lombard	69	" About this motor boat "
22200	22238	22197	22197	He	88	" know what you 're thinking , Mr. Lombard . I 've asked myself the same question . Motor boat ought to have been here nigh on two hours ago . It has n't come ? Why ? "
22239	22244	22246	22246	Lombard	69	" Found the answer ? "
22248	22276	22246	22246	Lombard	69	" It 's not an accident that 's what say . It 's part and parcel of the whole business . It 's all bound up together . "
22281	22290	22277	22278	Philip Lombard	69	" It wo n't come , you think ? "
22301	22309	22310	22310	he	69	" The motor boat 's not coming , "
22326	22334	22313	22313	Blore	88	" You think not too , General ? "
22340	22399	22335	22336	General Macarthur	77	" Of course it wo n't come . We 're counting on the motor boat to take us off the island . That 's the meaning of the whole business . We 're not going to leave the island ... None of us will ever leave ... Il 's the end , you see the end of everything ... "
22412	22435	22404	22404	he	69	" That 's peace real peace . To come to the end not to have to go on ... Yes , peace ... "
22488	22511	22485	22485	Blore	88	" There goes another one who 's balmy ! Looks as though it 'll end with the whole lot going that way . "
22516	22525	22512	22513	Philip Lombard	69	" do n't fancy you will , Blore . "
22530	22543	22544	22544	He	911	" It would take a lot to send me off my head . "
22548	22564	22544	22544	He	911	" And do n't think you 'll be going that way either , Mr. Lombard . "
22569	22580	22565	22566	Philip Lombard	69	" feel quite sane at the minute , thank you . "
22644	22656	22636	22636	Rogers	89	" Could have a word with you , sir , please ? "
22704	22721	22722	22723	The doctor	285	" Please , sir , if could have a word with you . Inside , sir . "
22738	22750	22735	22735	He	285	" What 's the matter , man ? Pull yourself together . "
22751	22761	22762	22762	He	285	" In here , sir , come in here . "
22783	22786	22788	22788	Armstrong	80	" Well , "
22790	22795	22788	22788	Armstrong	80	" what is it ? "
22812	22826	22827	22827	Armstrong	80	" There 's things going on , sir , that do n't understand . "
22831	22837	22827	22827	Armstrong	80	" Things ? What things ? "
22838	22881	22827	22827	Armstrong	80	" You 'll think I 'm crazy , sir . You 'll say it is n't anything . But it 's got to be explained , sir . It 's got to be explained . Because it does n't make any sense . "
22882	22901	22902	22902	Rogers	89	" Well , man , tell me what it is ? Do n't go on talking in riddles . "
22909	22947	22906	22906	He	80	" It 's those little figures , sir . In the middle of the table . The little china figures . Ten of them , there were . I 'll swear to that , ten of them . "
22951	22964	22948	22948	Armstrong	80	" Yes , ten . We counted them last night at dinner . "
22969	23028	22965	22965	Rogers	89	" That 's just it , sir . Last night , when was clearing up , there was n't but nine , sir . noticed it and thought it queer . But that 's all thought . And now , sir , this morning . did n't notice when laid the breakfast . was upset and all that . "
23050	23073	23044	23044	you	1898	" There 's only eight , sir ! Only eight ! It does n't make sense , does it ? Only eight ... "
23163	23192	23159	23160	Emily Brent	74	" The man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of person . It is really very odd that he should be so late this morning . "
23214	23233	23208	23208	She	121	" You must keep cool . This is n't like you . You 've always had excellent nerves . "
23243	23255	23235	23235	she	121	" wish he would come . 11 want to get away . "
23261	23270	23256	23257	Emily Brent	74	" I 've no doubt we all do . "
23274	23290	23271	23271	Vera	121	" It 's all so extraordinary ... There seems no no meaning in it all . "
23299	23336	23291	23295	The elderly woman beside her	929	" I 'm very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in . Really that letter is absurd when one comes to examine it . But had no doubts at the time none at all . "
23341	23345	23337	23337	Vera	121	" suppose not . "
23346	23355	23357	23358	Emily Brent	74	" One takes things for granted too much , "
23370	23381	23367	23367	She	121	" Do you really think what you said at breakfast ? "
23382	23400	23401	23401	Vera	121	" Be a little more precise , my dear . To what in particular are you referring ? "
23408	23425	23401	23401	Vera	121	" Do you really think that Rogers and his wife did away with that old lady ? "
23438	23452	23435	23435	she	74	" Personally , am quite sure of it . What do you think ? "
23453	23461	23462	23463	Emily Brent	74	" do n't know what to think . "
23466	23514	23462	23463	Emily Brent	74	" Everything goes to support the idea . The way the woman fainted . And the man dropped the coffee tray , remember . Then the way he spoke about it it did n't ring true . Oh , yes , I 'm afraid they did it . "
23518	23548	23515	23515	Vera	121	" The way she looked scared of her own shadow ! I 've never seen a woman look so frightened ... She must have been always haunted by it ... "
23553	23595	23549	23550	Miss Brent	74	" remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' It 's very true , that . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' "
23605	23615	23602	23602	She	121	" But , Miss Brent Miss Brent in that case "
23616	23622	23685	23685	She	74	" Yes , my dear ? "
23623	23632	23685	23685	She	74	" The others ? What about the others ? "
23633	23640	23602	23602	She	121	" do n't quite understand you . "
23641	23660	23661	23661	She	121	" All the other accusations they they were n't true ? But if it 's true about the Rogerses "
23688	23714	23685	23685	She	74	" Ah , understand you now . Well , there is that Mr. Lombard . He admits to having abandoned twenty men to their deaths . "
23718	23724	23715	23715	Vera	121	" They were only natives ... "
23730	23740	23725	23726	Emily Brent	74	" Black or white , they are our brothers . "
23744	23769	23741	23741	Vera	121	" Our black brothers our black brothers . Oh , I 'm going to laugh . I 'm hysterical . I 'm not myself ... "
23775	23820	23821	23821	She	74	" Of course , some of the other accusations were very farfetched and ridiculous . Against the judge , for instance , who was only doing his duty in his public capacity , And the exScotland Yard man . My own case , too . "
23828	23855	23821	23821	She	74	" Naturally , considering the circumstances , was not going to say anything last night . It was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemen . "
23856	23859	23860	23860	Vera	121	" No ? "
23870	23951	23952	23952	She	74	" Beatrice Taylor was in service with me . Not a nice girl as found out too late . was very much deceived in her . She had nice manners and was very clean and willing . was very pleased with her . Of course all that was the sheerest hypocrisy ! She was a loose girl with no morals . Disgusting ! It was some time before found out that she was what they call ' in trouble . ' "
23963	24000	24001	24001	Vera	121	" It was a great shock to me . Her parents were decent folk , too , who had brought her up very strictly . I 'm glad to say they did not condone her behaviour . "
24009	24013	24001	24001	Vera	121	" What happened ? "
24014	24035	24036	24036	Vera	121	" Naturally did not keep her an hour under my roof . No one shall ever say that condoned immorality . "
24043	24049	24036	24036	Vera	121	" What happened to her ? "
24054	24081	24050	24051	Miss Brent	74	" The abandoned creature , not content with having one sin on her conscience , committed a still graver sin . She took her own life . "
24087	24092	24082	24082	Vera	121	" She killed herself ? "
24093	24103	24104	24104	Vera	121	" Yes , she threw herself into the river . "
24121	24146	24118	24118	She	74	" What did you feel like when you knew she 'd done that ? Were n't you sorry ? Did n't you blame yourself ? "
24153	24164	24165	24165	Vera	121	" I ? had nothing with which to reproach myself . "
24168	24177	24165	24165	Vera	121	" But if your hardness drove her to it "
24183	24215	24216	24216	She	74	" Her own action her own sin that was what drove her to it . If she had behaved like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happened . "
24398	24409	24392	24392	He	80	" Lombard , can speak to you for a minute ? "
24413	24417	24410	24410	Philip	69	" Of course . "
24444	24449	24441	24441	Armstrong	80	" want a consultation . "
24459	24470	24456	24456	He	69	" My dear fellow , I 've no medical knowledge . "
24471	24483	24441	24441	Armstrong	80	" No , no , mean as to the general situation . "
24484	24491	24492	24492	Armstrong	80	" Oh , that 's different . "
24495	24506	24492	24492	Armstrong	80	" Frankly , what do you think of the position ? "
24516	24526	24513	24513	he	69	" It 's rather suggestive , is n't it ? "
24527	24546	24547	24547	Philip	69	" What are your ideas on the subject of that woman ? Do you accept Blore 's theory ? "
24557	24565	24554	24554	He	80	" It 's perfectly feasible taken alone . "
24566	24569	24570	24570	Armstrong	80	" Exactly . "
24587	24631	24632	24632	Armstrong	80	" That is , accepting the premise that Mr. and Mrs. Rogers have successfully got away with murder in their time . And do n't see why they should n't . What do you think they did exactly ? Poisoned the old lady ? "
24636	24715	24632	24632	Armstrong	80	" It might be simpler than that . asked Rogers this morning what this Miss Brady had suffered from . His answer was enlightening . do n't need to go into medical details , but in a certain form of cardiac trouble , amyl nitrite is used . When an attack comes on an ampoule of amyl nitrite is broken and it is inhaled . If amyl nitrite were withheld well , the consequences might easily be fatal . "
24721	24734	24716	24717	Philip Lombard	69	" As simple as that . It must have been rather tempting . "
24739	24779	24735	24736	The doctor	285	" Yes , no positive action . No arsenic to obtain and administer nothing definite just negation ! And Rogers hurried through the night to fetch a doctor and they both felt confident that no one could ever know . "
24780	24797	24799	24800	Philip Lombard	69	" And , even if any one knew , nothing could ever be proved against them , "
24806	24815	24802	24802	He	69	" Of course that explains a good deal . "
24821	24826	24827	24827	Lombard	69	" beg your pardon . "
24830	24871	24827	24827	Lombard	69	" mean it explains Indian Island . There are crimes that can not be brought home to their perpetrators . Instance , the Rogerses ' . Another instance , old Wargrave , who committed his murder strictly within the law . "
24876	24882	24872	24872	Armstrong	80	" You believe that story ? "
24887	24950	24883	24884	Philip Lombard	69	" Oh , yes , believe it . Wargrave murdered Edward Seton all right , murdered him as surely as if he 'd stuck a stiletto through him ! But he was clever enough to do it from the judge 's seat in wig and gown . So in the ordinary way you ca n't bring his little crime home to him . "
24962	24980	24981	24982	Philip Lombard	69	" Murder in Hospital . Murder on the Operating Table . Safe yes , safe as houses ! "
24986	24994	24981	24982	Philip Lombard	69	" Hence Mr. Owen hence Indian Island ! "
25001	25021	24995	24995	Armstrong	80	" Now we 're getting down to it . What 's the real purpose of getting us all here ? "
25026	25032	25022	25023	Philip Lombard	69	" What do you think ? "
25037	25085	25033	25033	Armstrong	80	" Let 's go back a minute to this woman 's death . What are the possible theories ? Rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show away . Second possibility : She lost her nerve and took an easy way out herself . "
25090	25095	25086	25087	Philip Lombard	69	" Suicide , eh ? "
25096	25104	25105	25105	Lombard	69	" What do you say to that ? "
25108	25229	25230	25230	Armstrong	80	" It could have been yes if it had n't been for Marston 's death . Two suicides within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow ! And if you tell me that Anthony Marston , a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains , got the wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself out of the way well , the idea 's laughable ! And anyway , how did he get hold of the stuff ? From all I 've ever heard , Potassium Cyanide is n't the kind of stuff you take about with you in your waistcoat pocket . But that 's your line of country . "
25233	25259	25230	25230	Armstrong	80	" Nobody in their senses carries Potassium Cyanide . It might be done by some one who was going to take a wasps ' nest . "
25260	25310	25311	25311	Armstrong	80	" The ardent gardener or landowner , in fact ? Again , not Anthony Marston . It strikes me that Cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining . Either Anthony Marston meant to do away with himself before he came here , and therefore came prepared or else "
25315	25319	25311	25311	Armstrong	80	" Or else ? "
25324	25350	25320	25321	Philip Lombard	69	" Why make me say it ? When it 's on the tip of your own tongue . Anthony Marston was murdered , of course . "
25358	25363	25364	25364	Lombard	69	" And Mrs. Rogers ? "
25368	25445	25364	25364	Lombard	69	" could believe in Anthony 's suicide ( with difficulty ) if it were n't for Mrs. Rogers . could believe in Mrs. Rogers ' suicide ( easily ) if it were n't for Anthony Marston . can believe that Rogers put his wife out of the way if it were not for the unexplained death of Anthony Marston . But what we need is a theory to explain two deaths following rapidly on each other . "
25449	25460	25446	25446	Armstrong	80	" can perhaps give you some help towards that theory . "
25484	25510	25481	25481	Lombard	69	" Yes , litde china Indian figures ... There were certainly ten last night at dinner . And now there are eight , you say ? "
25515	25536	25511	25512	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Ten little Indian boys going out to dine ; One went and choked himself and then there were nine . "
25555	25573	25546	25546	One	98	" The two men looked at each other . Philip Lombard grinned and flung away his cigarette . "
25604	25605	25599	25599	herself	144	" "
25609	25618	25599	25599	herself	144	" said Armstrong . Lombard took him up . "
25646	25647	25640	25644	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	954	" "
25650	25658	25640	25644	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	954	" Armstrong breathed a sigh of relief . "
25687	25688	25689	25689	Rogers	89	" "
25699	25705	25709	25709	he	954	" Armstrong shook his head . "
25727	25735	25718	25718	He	954	" Philip Lombard nodded . He said : "
25770	25779	25767	25767	his	54	" Armstrong had gone pale . He said : "
25790	25805	25786	25788	a raving maniac	964	" Philip Lombard said , and there was a new ring in his voice : "
25816	25817	25810	25811	Mr. Owen	54	" "
25822	25823	25810	25811	Mr. Owen	54	" "
25853	25859	25851	25851	Esq	145	" Dr. Armstrong said warningly : "
25865	25870	25860	25860	He	553	" Philip Lombard laughed . "
25892	25898	25899	25899	We	967	" He paused and said : "
25957	25972	25947	25950	The three of us	972	" Blore was easily roped in . He expressed immediate agreement with their arguments . "
26023	26024	26026	26026	yourself	973	" "
26030	26031	26026	26026	yourself	973	" "
26077	26094	26058	26058	he	119	" Armstrong shook his head . He stressed the point about the Cyanide . Blore agreed . "
26124	26128	26122	26122	sir	1898	" Lombard said : "
26216	26221	26203	26203	Somebody	979	" Blore said unbelievingly : "
26230	26235	26228	26228	sir	1898	" Lombard said drily : "
26243	26248	26228	26228	sir	1898	" Armstrong said slowly : "
26286	26292	26259	26259	We	980	" Blore shrugged his shoulders . "
26332	26336	26337	26337	I	0	" Lombard said : "
26342	26362	26337	26337	I	0	" He patted his pocket . Blore 's eyes opened very wide . He said in an overcasual tone : "
26372	26376	26337	26337	I	0	" Lombard said : "
26390	26391	26379	26379	I	0	" "
26394	26400	26379	26379	I	0	" said Blore and added : "
26447	26451	26427	26427	he	987	" Armstrong coughed . "
26473	26477	26458	26458	Blore	88	" Blore said : "
26494	26672	26491	26492	Dr. Armstrong	80	" The three men started on their tour of the island . It proved unexpectedly simple . On the northwest side , towards the coast , the cliffs fell sheer to the sea below , their surface unbroken . On the rest of the island there were no trees and very little cover . The three men worked carefully and methodically , beating up and down from the highest point to the water 's edge , narrowly scanning the least irregularity in the rock which might point to the entrance to a cave . But there were no caves . They came at last , skirting the water 's edge , to where General Macarthur sat looking out to sea . It was very peaceful here with the lap of the waves breaking over the rocks . The old man sat very upright , his eyes fixed on the horizon . He paid no attention to the approach of the searchers . His oblivion of them made one at least faintly uncomfortable . Blore thought to himself : "
26688	26701	26679	26679	he	993	" He cleared his throat and said in a wouldbe conversational tone : "
26713	26730	26705	26705	you	995	" The General frowned . He cast a quick look over his shoulder . He said : "
26749	26754	26755	26755	We	998	" Blore said genially : "
26790	26797	26798	26798	You	995	" The General frowned and said : "
26813	26827	26828	26828	He	1001	" Blore retreated . He said , as he joined the other two : "
26840	26847	26850	26850	he	1001	" Lombard asked with some curiosity : "
26853	26859	26850	26850	he	1001	" Blore shrugged his shoulders . "
26876	26884	26850	26850	he	1001	" Dr. Armstrong frowned . He murmured : "
26888	26926	26850	26850	he	1001	" The search of the island was practically completed . The three men stood on the highest point looking over towards the mainland . There were no boats out . The wind was freshening . Lombard said : "
26956	26960	26949	26949	We	1004	" Blore said : "
26968	26974	26949	26949	We	1004	" Lombard said , frowning : "
26989	26990	26949	26949	We	1004	" "
26997	26998	26949	26949	We	1004	" "
27044	27049	27038	27041	Some damn fool story	1008	" Blore said dubiously : "
27056	27061	27038	27041	Some damn fool story	1008	" Lombard said drily : "
27101	27106	27096	27096	they	1009	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
27119	27133	27141	27141	You	995	" Philip Lombard , his lips curling back from his teeth , said : "
27148	27160	27141	27141	You	995	" Blore was gazing down into the water . He said : "
27170	27176	27141	27141	You	995	" Armstrong shook his head . "
27191	27195	27188	27188	he	1015	" Blore said : "
27219	27223	27188	27188	he	1015	" Lombard said : "
27241	27242	27188	27188	he	1015	" "
27248	27253	27188	27188	he	1015	" Lombard said suddenly : "
27301	27305	27292	27292	you	1025	" Blore said : "
27332	27374	27322	27322	I	0	" He started off briskly down to the house . Lombard stared up at the sky . The clouds were beginning to mass themselves together . The wind was increasing . He shot a sideways look at Armstrong . He said : "
27387	27392	27384	27384	you	1898	" Armstrong said slowly : "
27402	27662	27399	27399	Macarthur	77	" Vera had been restless all the morning . She had avoided Emily Brent with a kind of shuddering aversion . Miss Brent herself had taken a chair just round the corner of the house so as to be out of the wind . She sat there knitting . Every time Vera thought of her she seemed to see a pale drowned face with seaweed entangled in the hair ... A face that had once been pretty impudently pretty perhaps and which was now beyond the reach of pity or terror . And Emily Brent , placid and righteous , sat knitting . On the main terrace , Mr. Justice Wargrave sat huddled in a porter 's chair . His head was poked down well into his neck . When Vera looked at him , she saw a man standing in the dock a young man with fair hair and blue eyes and a bewildered , frightened face . Edward Seton . And in imagination she saw the judge 's old hands put the black cap on his head and begin to pronounce sentence ... After a while Vera strolled slowly down to the sea . She walked along towards the extreme end of the island where an old man sat staring out to the horizon . General Macarthur stirred at her approach . His head turned there was a queer mixture of questioning and apprehension in his look . It startled her . He stared intently at her for a minute or two . She thought to herself : "
27674	27678	27671	27671	he	1027	" He said : "
27689	27699	27685	27685	You	1028	" Vera sat down beside him . She said : "
27710	27717	27685	27685	You	1028	" He nodded his head gently . "
27720	27724	27685	27685	You	1028	" he said . "
27740	27741	27685	27685	You	1028	" "
27745	27750	27685	27685	You	1028	" said Vera sharply . "
27757	27762	27753	27753	you	1028	" He said gently : "
27792	27797	27800	27800	you	1027	" She said unsteadily : "
27803	27809	27800	27800	you	1027	" General Macarthur said gravely : "
27846	27851	27838	27838	you	1028	" Vera said wonderingly : "
27855	27859	27838	27838	you	1028	" He said : "
27916	27921	27908	27908	You	1028	" Vera said hoarsely : "
27927	27947	27908	27908	You	1028	" Her fingers worked spasmodically . She felt suddenly afraid of this quiet old soldier . He said musingly : "
27959	27964	27908	27908	You	1028	" Vera said questioningly : "
27970	27971	27908	27908	You	1028	" "
27994	28008	27986	27986	She	133	" He was silent for a minute or two , then he said : "
28020	28024	28025	28025	You	1027	" Vera said : "
28027	28038	28025	28025	You	1027	" and paused . General Macarthur nodded his head gently . "
28115	28124	28175	28175	you	1037	" In a hard voice , Vera said : "
28129	28144	28175	28175	you	1037	" He shook his head vaguely . He looked puzzled and a little distressed . "
28205	28209	28258	28258	you	0	" Vera said : "
28212	28231	28232	28232	You	0	" and the echo of her voice came back to her from the rocks . General Macarthur said : "
28244	28253	28258	28258	you	0	" Vera got up . She said sharply : "
28261	28265	28258	28258	you	0	" He said : "
28273	28274	28275	28275	You	0	" "
28286	28311	28312	28312	Leslie	133	" General Macarthur looked out to sea again . He seemed unconscious of her presence behind him . He said very gently and softly : "
28315	28348	28312	28312	Leslie	133	" When Blore returned from the house with a rope coiled over his arm , he found Armstrong where he had left him staring down into the depths . Blore said breathlessly : "
28354	28359	28351	28352	Mr. Lombard	92	" Armstrong said carelessly : "
28385	28386	28379	28379	Blore	88	" "
28394	28402	28379	28379	Blore	88	" The doctor waved an impatient hand . "
28422	28423	28419	28420	old Macarthur	77	" "
28430	28436	28426	28426	him	77	" Dr. Armstrong said grimly : "
28450	28455	28456	28456	You	0	" Blore said incredulously : "
28462	28467	28456	28456	You	0	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
28509	28514	28502	28502	him	77	" Blore said doubtfully : "
28525	28542	28543	28543	You	0	" Armstrong cut in with a slight effort as of a man who pulls himself together . "
28568	28578	28566	28566	Lombard	92	" They fastened the rope carefully . Lombard said : "
28597	28616	28624	28624	he	92	" After a minute or two , while they stood together watching Lombard 's progress , Blore said : "
28626	28639	28624	28624	he	92	" There was something odd in his voice . Dr. Armstrong said : "
28652	28653	28642	28642	he	92	" "
28656	28666	28642	28642	he	92	" There was a silence and the exinspector said : "
28678	28679	28673	28673	D'you	1044	" "
28682	28683	28673	28673	D'you	1044	" "
28691	28696	28684	28684	He	92	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
28701	28709	28673	28673	D'you	1044	" Blore grunted . Then he said : "
28723	28728	28719	28719	him	92	" Dr. Armstrong said ; "
28737	28741	28719	28719	him	92	" Blore said : "
28755	28763	28719	28719	him	92	" He paused and then went on : "
28777	28781	28765	28765	you	1044	" Armstrong stared . "
28793	28797	28791	28791	I	0	" Blore said : "
28803	28808	28800	28801	Mr. Lombard	92	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
28812	28843	28800	28801	Mr. Lombard	92	" Blore snorted . A sudden pull came on the rope . For some moments they had their hands full . Presently , when the strain relaxed , Blore said : "
28907	28958	28897	28897	people	1853	" Dr. Armstrong shook his head perplexedly . They leaned over and watched Lombard 's progress . His search was thorough and they could see at once that it was futile . Presently he came up over the edge of the cliff . He wiped the perspiration from his forehead . "
28961	28965	28966	28966	We	1050	" he said . "
28979	29077	29081	29083	the good servant	1053	" The house was easily searched . They went through the few outbuildings first and then turned their attention to the building itself . Mrs. Rogers ' yard measure discovered in the kitchen dresser assisted them . But there were no hidden spaces left unaccounted for . Everything was plain and straightforward , a modern structure devoid of concealments . They went through the ground floor first . As they mounted to the bedroom floor , they saw through the landing window Rogers carrying out a tray of cocktails to the terrace . Philip Lombard said lightly : "
29092	29097	29098	29098	Rogers	89	" Armstrong said appreciatively : "
29111	29115	29104	29104	I	0	" Blore said : "
29130	29160	29104	29104	I	0	" They turned in to the first bedroom . Five minutes later they faced each other on the landing . No one hiding no possible hidingplace . Blore said : "
29168	29173	29104	29104	I	0	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
29183	29187	29104	29104	I	0	" Blore said : "
29214	29257	29413	29413	Rogers	89	" And it was then , as they stood there , that they heard the sound from above . A soft furtive footfall overhead . They all heard it . Armstrong grasped Blore 's arm . Lombard held up an admonitory finger . "
29261	29277	29278	29278	He	1061	" It came again some one moving softly , furtively , overhead . Armstrong whispered : "
29295	29300	29289	29290	Mrs. Rogers	89	" Blore whispered back : "
29324	29364	29321	29321	you	1066	" They crept stealthily upstairs . On the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again . Yes , some one was in the room . There was a faint creak from within . Blore whispered : "
29367	29410	29321	29321	you	1066	" He flung open the door and rushed in , the other two close behind him . Then all three stopped dead . Rogers was in the room , his hands full of garments . Blore recovered himself first . He said : "
29426	29433	29416	29421	some one moving about in here	1067	" He stopped . Rogers said : "
29470	29483	29413	29413	Rogers	89	" It was to Armstrong that he spoke , and Armstrong replied : "
29495	29511	29513	29513	you	1952	" He avoided looking at the sheeted figure lying on the bed . Rogers said : "
29517	29576	29513	29513	you	1952	" He went out of the room with his arm full of belongings and went down the stairs to the floor below . Armstrong moved over to the bed and , lifting the sheet , looked down on the peaceful face of the dead woman . There was no fear there now . Just emptiness . Armstrong said : "
29595	29604	29585	29585	I	0	" Then he turned to the other two . "
29623	29638	29639	29640	That chap	1075	" Blore was wrestling with the bolts of a low manhole . He said : "
29665	29669	29661	29661	him	1075	" Lombard said : "
29686	29749	29679	29680	a stranger	1078	" Blore disappeared into a cavernous darkness . Lombard pulled a torch from his pocket and followed . Five minutes later three men stood on an upper landing and looked at each other . They were dirty and festooned with cobwebs and their faces were grim . There was no one on the island but their eight selves . Lombard said slowly : "
29776	29781	29798	29799	a doctor	284	" Armstrong said gravely : "
29814	29819	29806	29807	Anthony Marston	87	" Lombard said doubtfully : "
29831	29837	29806	29807	Anthony Marston	87	" Blore snorted , unconvinced . "
29844	29857	29806	29807	Anthony Marston	87	" he grunted . There was a pause , then Blore said : "
29861	29865	29866	29867	Mrs. Rogers	89	" and stopped . "
29869	29870	29866	29867	Mrs. Rogers	89	" "
29889	29894	29806	29807	Anthony Marston	87	" Philip Lombard said : "
29902	29927	29806	29807	Anthony Marston	87	" Blore looked slightly embarrassed . His redbrick face grew a little deeper in hue . He said , almost blurting out the words : "
29943	29949	29933	29933	you	735	" Armstrong stared at him . "
29957	29958	29954	29954	you	735	" "
29975	29976	29962	29962	You	735	" "
29987	29988	29962	29962	You	735	" "
29994	29995	29962	29962	You	735	" "
30009	30018	29962	29962	You	735	" Blore grew redder still . He said : "
30036	30042	30034	30034	you	735	" Dr. Armstrong said angrily : "
30050	30054	30047	30047	you	735	" Blore said : "
30079	30084	30110	30110	you	735	" Armstrong said sharply : "
30096	30107	30110	30110	you	735	" He stopped and added in a cold biting tone : "
30120	30126	30110	30110	you	735	" Philip Lombard said quickly : "
30148	30153	30156	30157	the doctor	285	" Blore said sullenly : "
30163	30183	30184	30184	Doctors	1087	" Dr. Armstrong smiled with an effort . He said , showing his teeth in a somewhat mirthless smile : "
30198	30203	30184	30184	Doctors	1087	" Blore said deliberately : "
30222	30236	30184	30184	Doctors	1087	" Armstrong went white . Philip Lombard said quickly and angrily to Blore : "
30271	30289	30263	30263	your	735	" Blore took a step forward , his hands clenched . He said in a thick voice : "
30326	30332	30324	30324	you	92	" Lombard 's eyebrows rose . "
30336	30337	30324	30324	you	92	" "
30356	30360	30361	30361	You	92	" Lombard said : "
30367	30368	30373	30374	Mr. Lombard	92	" "
30376	30381	30373	30374	Mr. Lombard	92	" Lombard said unexpectedly : "
30398	30399	30385	30385	Blore	88	" "
30411	30415	30373	30374	Mr. Lombard	92	" Lombard smiled . "
30428	30433	30434	30434	You	92	" Blore said suspiciously : "
30443	30449	30434	30434	You	92	" Lombard shook his head . "
30457	30461	30450	30450	You	92	" Blore persisted . "
30468	30472	30450	30450	You	92	" said Lombard . "
30482	30487	30450	30450	You	92	" Lombard said slowly : "
30560	30561	30552	30554	a good man	276	" "
30564	30575	30552	30554	a good man	276	" Blore prompted impatiently . Lombard said with a grin : "
30580	30585	30552	30554	a good man	276	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
30595	30596	30588	30588	he	1094	" "
30630	30638	30620	30620	his	1094	" Blore looked unconvinced . He said : "
30650	30651	30642	30642	you	92	" "
30655	30661	30620	30620	his	1094	" Lombard shrugged eloquent shoulders . "
30688	30694	30697	30697	you	92	" Dr. Armstrong said shrewdly : "
30701	30715	30697	30697	you	92	" Lombard 's face changed . It darkened and hardened . He said : "
30758	30763	30738	30739	Mr. Owen	54	" He said slowly : "
30817	30859	30813	30814	Mr. Owen	54	" Downstairs the gong pealed a solemn call to lunch . Rogers was standing by the diningroom door . As the three men descended the stairs he moved a step or two forward . He said in a low anxious voice : "
30892	30896	30813	30814	Mr. Owen	54	" Lombard said : "
30908	30909	30916	30916	sir	1898	" "
30956	30972	30991	30991	you	1898	" Lombard nodded . Rogers murmured as he followed the three men into the diningroom : "
30995	30996	30991	30991	you	1898	" "
30999	31003	30991	30991	you	1898	" said Lombard , "
31011	31046	30991	30991	you	1898	" Miss Brent came into the room . She had just dropped a ball of wool and was carefully rewinding the end of it . As she took her seat at table she remarked : "
31066	31101	31102	31102	You	1898	" Mr. Justice Wargrave came in . He walked with a slow measured tread . He darted quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of the diningroom . He said : "
31109	31137	31139	31139	you	1898	" There was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice . Vera Claythorne hurried in . She was a little out of breath . She said quickly : "
31149	31154	31155	31155	You	1898	" Emily Brent said : "
31168	31180	31161	31162	The General	2066	" They sat round the table . Rogers addressed Miss Brent : "
31192	31196	31189	31189	you	1898	" Vera said : "
31218	31221	31222	31222	he	77	" she hesitated "
31231	31236	31222	31222	he	77	" Rogers said quickly : "
31247	31253	31222	31222	he	77	" Dr. Armstrong jumped up . "
31258	31262	31254	31254	I	0	" he said . "
31268	31282	31263	31263	You	1111	" He left the room . Behind him he heard Rogers ' voice . "
31294	31326	31292	31292	Madam	2025	" The five people sitting round the table seemed to find conversation difficult . Outside sudden gusts of wind came up and died away . Vera shivered a little and said : "
31333	31346	31349	31351	an old fellow	1114	" Blore made a contribution to the discourse . He said conversationally : "
31377	31409	31359	31359	He	1114	" Rogers went round the table collecting the meat plates . Suddenly , with the plates held in his hands , he stopped . He said in an odd scared voice : "
31415	31469	31470	31471	General Macarthur	77	" They could all hear it running feet along the terrace . In that minute , they knew knew without being told ... As by common accord , they all rose to their feet . They stood looking towards the door . Dr. Armstrong appeared , his breath coming fast . He said : "
31472	31473	31470	31471	General Macarthur	77	" "
31476	31487	31490	31490	he	77	" The voice burst from Vera explosively . Armstrong said : "
31494	31636	31639	31639	Miss	1117	" There was a pause a long pause . Seven people looked at each other and could find no words to say . The storm broke just as the old man 's body was borne in through the door . The others were standing in the hall . There was a sudden hiss and roar as the rain came down . As Blore and Armstrong passed up the stairs with their burden , Vera Claythorne turned suddenly and went into the deserted diningroom . It was as they had left it . The sweet course stood ready on the sideboard untasted , Vera went up to the table . She was there a minute or two later when Rogers came softly into the room . He started when he saw her . Then his eyes asked a question . He said : "
31647	31659	31639	31639	Miss	1117	" In a loud harsh voice that surprised herself Vera said : "
31676	31790	31793	31793	doctor	735	" General Macarthur had been laid on his bed . After making a last examination Armstrong left the room and came downstairs . He found the others assembled in the drawingroom . Miss Brent was knitting . Vera Claythorne was standing by the window looking out at the hissing rain , Blore was sitting squarely in a chair , his hands on his knees . Lombard was walking restlessly up and down . At the far end of the room Mr. Justice Wargrave was sitting in a grandfather chair . His eyes were half closed . They opened as the doctor came into the room . He said in a clear penetrating voice : "
31795	31804	31793	31793	doctor	735	" Armstrong was very pale . He said : "
31833	31852	31815	31815	Macarthur	77	" A little murmur went round , but the clear voice of the judge was raised once more . "
31861	31862	31854	31854	you	735	" "
31865	31866	31854	31854	you	735	" "
31875	31876	31868	31868	you	735	" "
31881	31888	31868	31868	you	735	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said quietly : "
31897	31960	31868	31868	you	735	" There was no doubt now who was in charge of the situation . This morning Wargrave had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refraining from any overt activity . Now he assumed command with the ease born of a long habit of authority . He definitely presided over the court . Clearing his throat , he once more spoke . "
31999	32000	31989	31989	You	1952	" "
32006	32016	32004	32004	sir	1898	" said Philip Lombard . The judge went on . "
32069	32074	32060	32061	Mr. Owen	54	" Blore said hoarsely : "
32083	32088	32080	32081	A loony	1130	" The judge coughed . "
32110	32118	32130	32131	No one	2236	" Armstrong said in a trembling voice : "
32133	32144	32130	32131	No one	2236	" The judge stroked his jaw . He said gently : "
32256	32269	32244	32245	Mr. Owen	54	" It is perfectly clear . Mr. Owen is one of us ... "
32270	32279	32282	32282	Vera	121	" Oh , no , no , no ... "
32303	32399	32300	32300	He	336	" My dear young lady , this is no time for refusing to look facts in the face . We are all in grave danger . One of us is U.N. Owen . And we do not know which of us . Of the ten people who came to this island three are definitely cleared . Anthony Marston , Mrs. Rogers , and General Macarthur have gone beyond suspicion . There are seven of us left . Of those seven , one is , if may so express myself , a bogus little Indian boy . "
32406	32415	32400	32400	He	336	" Do take it that you all agree ? "
32419	32429	32416	32416	Armstrong	80	" It 's fantastic but suppose you 're right . "
32433	32452	32430	32430	Blore	88	" Not a doubt of it . And if you ask me , I 've a very good idea "
32470	32495	32465	32466	The judge	336	" We will come to that presently . At the moment all wish to establish is that we are in agreement on the facts . "
32504	32521	32496	32497	Emily Brent	74	" Your argument seems logical . agree that one of us is possessed by a devil . "
32525	32534	32522	32522	Vera	121	" ca n't believe it ... ca n't ... "
32538	32541	32535	32535	Wargrave	53	" Lombard ? "
32542	32549	32550	32551	The judge	336	" agree , sir , absolutely . "
32563	32597	32560	32560	He	336	" Now let us examine the evidence . To begin with , is there any reason for suspecting one particular person ? Mr. Blore , you have , think , something to say . "
32606	32626	32603	32603	He	88	" Lombard 's got a revolver . He did n't tell the truth last night . He admits it . "
32635	32643	32632	32632	He	69	" suppose I 'd better explain again . "
32659	32674	32655	32655	Blore	88	" What 's to prove it ? There 's nothing to corroborate your story . "
32679	32682	32683	32683	he	336	" Unfortunately , "
32686	32704	32705	32705	He	336	" we are all in that position . There is only our own word to go upon . "
32709	32758	32705	32705	He	336	" You have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is . To my mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt . Is there any one whom we can definitely eliminate from suspicion on the evidence which is in our possession ? "
32764	32779	32759	32760	Dr. Armstrong	80	" am a wellknown professional man . The mere idea that can be suspected of "
32807	32843	32844	32844	he	53	" I , too , am a wellknown person ! But , my dear sir , that proves less than nothing ! Doctors have gone mad before now . Judges have gone mad . So , "
32851	32855	32844	32844	he	53	" have policemen ! "
32859	32874	32856	32856	Lombard	69	" At any rate , suppose you 'll leave the women out of it . "
32886	32888	32881	32881	He	336	" acid "
32896	32911	32881	32881	He	336	" Do understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal mania ? "
32916	32930	32931	32931	He	336	" Of course not . But all the same , it hardly seems possible "
32947	32971	32972	32973	The doctor	285	" take it , Dr. Armstrong , that a woman would have been physically capable of striking the blow that killed poor Macarthur ? "
32977	32993	32972	32973	The doctor	285	" Perfectly capable given a suitable instrument , such as a rubber truncheon or cosh . "
32994	33004	32972	32973	The doctor	285	" It would require no undue exertion of force ? "
33005	33010	33011	33013	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Not at all . "
33022	33054	33019	33019	He	53	" The other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs . That , no one will dispute , is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength . "
33059	33065	33055	33055	Vera	121	" think you 're mad ! "
33096	33109	33093	33093	She	121	" He 's just seeing me as a as a specimen . And "
33118	33126	33130	33131	the judge	336	" he does n't like me much ! "
33135	33153	33130	33131	the judge	336	" My dear young lady , do try and restrain your feelings . am not accusing you . "
33160	33183	33154	33154	He	53	" hope , Miss Brent , that you are not offended by my insistence that all of us are equally under suspicion ? "
33202	33283	33199	33199	she	74	" The idea that should be accused of taking a fellow creature 's life not to speak of the lives of three fellow creatures is , of course , quite absurd to any one who knows anything of my character . But quite appreciate the fact that we are all strangers to one another and that in those circumstances , nobody can be exonerated without the fullest proof . There is , as have said , a devil amongst us . "
33288	33308	33284	33285	The judge	336	" Then we are agreed . There can be no elimination on the ground of character or position alone . "
33312	33317	33309	33309	Lombard	69	" What about Rogers ? "
33325	33330	33331	33331	Lombard	69	" What about him ? "
33334	33348	33331	33331	Lombard	69	" Well , to my mind , Rogers seems pretty well ruled out . "
33354	33362	33363	33363	Lombard	69	" Indeed , and on what grounds ? "
33366	33388	33363	33363	Lombard	69	" He has n't got the brains for one thing . And for another his wife was one of the victims . "
33401	33428	33398	33398	He	53	" In my time , young man , several people have come before me accused of the murders of their wives and have been found guilty . "
33429	33528	33529	33531	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Oh ! agree . Wife murder is perfectly possible almost natural , let 's say ! But not this particular kind ! can believe in Rogers killing his wife because he was scared of her breaking down and giving him away , or because he 'd taken a dislike to her , or because he wanted to link up with some nice little bit rather less long in the tooth . But ca n't see him as the lunatic Mr. Owen dealing out crazy justice and starting on his own wife for a crime they both committed . "
33534	33603	33604	33604	Lombard	69	" You are assuming hearsay to be evidence . We do not know that Rogers and his wife conspired to murder their employer . That may have been a false statement , made so that Rogers should appear to be in the same position as ourselves . Mrs. Rogers ' terror last night may have been due to the fact that she realized her husband was mentally unhinged . "
33607	33631	33604	33604	Lombard	69	" Well , have it your own way , U.N. Owen is one of us . No exceptions allowed . We all qualify . "
33637	33726	33632	33634	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" My point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of character , position , or probability . What we must now examine is the possibility of eliminating one or more persons on the facts . To put it simply , is there among us one or more persons who could not possibly have administered either Cyanide to Anthony Marston , or an overdose of sleeping draught to Mrs. Rogers , and who had no opportunity of striking the blow that killed General Macarthur ? "
33739	33747	33748	33748	he	88	" Now you 're talking , sir ! "
33751	33841	33748	33748	he	88	" That 's the stuff ! Let 's go into it . As regards young Marston do n't think there 's anything to be done . It 's already been suggested that some one from outside slipped something into the dregs of his glass before he refilled it for the last time . A person actually in the room could have done that even more easily . ca n't remember if Rogers was in the room , but any of the rest of us could certainly have done it . "
33849	33880	33842	33842	He	88	" Now take the woman Rogers . The people who stand out there are her husband and the doctor . Either of them could have done it as easy as winking "
33891	33908	33887	33887	He	80	" protest This is absolutely uncalled for ! swear that the dose gave the woman was perfectly "
33909	33913	33842	33842	He	88	" Dr. Armstrong . "
33941	34023	34024	34024	He	80	" Your indignation is very natural . Nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced . Either you or Rogers could have administered a fatal dose with the greatest ease . Let us now consider the position of the other people present . What chance had I , had Inspector Blore , had Miss Brent , had Miss Claythorne , had Mr. Lombard of administering poison ? Can any one of us be completely and entirely eliminated ? "
34027	34031	34032	34032	Vera	121	" think not . "
34036	34051	34032	34032	Vera	121	" was nowhere near the woman ! All of you can swear to that . "
34063	34155	34060	34060	he	53	" As far as my memory serves me the facts were these will any one please correct me if make a misstatement ? Mrs. Rogers was lifted onto the sofa by Anthony Marston and Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong went to her . He sent Rogers for brandy . There was then a question raised as to where the voice we had just heard had come from . We all went into the next room with the exception of Miss Brent who remained in this room alone with the unconscious woman . "
34174	34179	34171	34171	She	74	" This is outrageous ! "
34187	34209	34210	34211	Emily Brent	74	" When we returned to this room , you , Miss Brent , were bending over the woman on the sofa . "
34214	34222	34210	34211	Emily Brent	74	" Is common humanity a criminal offence ? "
34228	34286	34223	34225	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" am only establishing facts . Rogers then entered the room with the brandy which , of course , he could quite well have doctored before entering the room . The brandy was administered to the woman and shortly afterwards her husband and Dr. Armstrong assisted her up to bed where Dr. Armstrong gave her a sedative . "
34290	34313	34287	34287	Blore	150	" That 's what happened . Absolutely . And that lets out the judge , Mr. Lombard , myself and Miss Claythorne . "
34336	34352	34321	34323	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Ah , but does it ? We must take into account every possible eventuality . "
34359	34365	34356	34356	He	150	" do n't get you . "
34371	34469	34366	34368	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Upstairs in her room , Mrs. Rogers is lying in bed . The sedative that the doctor has given her begins to take effect . She is vaguely sleepy and acquiescent . Supposing that at that moment there is a tap on the door and some one enters bringing her , shall we say , a tablet , or a draught , with the message that ' the doctor says you 're to take this . ' Do you imagine for one minute that she would not have swallowed it obediently without thinking twice about it ? "
34486	34520	34482	34483	Philip Lombard	69	" do n't believe in that story for a minute . Besides none of us left this room for hours afterwards . There was Marston 's death and all the rest of it . "
34525	34537	34538	34538	Lombard	69	" Some one could have left his or her bedroom later . "
34541	34551	34538	34538	Lombard	69	" But then Rogers would have been up there . "
34556	34559	34560	34560	he	80	" No , "
34563	34592	34560	34560	he	80	" Rogers went downstairs to clear up in the diningroom and pantry . Any one could have gone up to the woman 's bedroom then without being seen . "
34597	34621	34593	34594	Emily Brent	74	" Surely , doctor , the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the influence of the drug you had administered ? "
34622	34684	34685	34685	Lombard	69	" In all likelihood , yes . But it is not a certainty . Until you have prescribed for a patient more than once you can not tell their reaction to different drugs . There is , sometimes , a considerable period before a sedative takes effect . It depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the patient towards that particular drug . "
34688	34703	34685	34685	Lombard	69	" Of course you would say that , doctor . Suits your book eh ? "
34726	34857	34858	34858	Blore	88	" No good result can come from recrimination . Facts are what we have to deal with . It is established , think , that there is a possibility of such a thing as have outlined occurring . agree that its probability value is not high ; though there again , it depends on who that person might have been . The appearance of Miss Brent or of Miss Claythorne on such an errand would have occasioned no surprise in the patient 's mind . agree that the appearance of myself , or of Mr. Blore , or of Mr. Lombard could have been , to say the least of it , unusual , but still think the visit would have been received without the awakening of any real suspicion . "
34861	34868	34858	34858	Blore	88	" And that gets us where ? "
34885	34912	34913	34913	He	53	" We have now dealt with the second killing , and have established the fact that no one of us can be completely exonerated from suspicion . "
34919	34988	34913	34913	He	53	" We come now to the death of General Macarthur . That took place this morning . will ask any one who considers that he or she has an alibi to state it in so many words . myself will state at once that have no valid alibi . spent the morning sitting on the terrace and meditating on the singular position in which we all find ourselves . "
35075	35079	35091	35091	They	1156	" Blore said : "
35097	35102	35091	35091	They	1156	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
35112	35116	35103	35103	You	92	" Blore said : "
35133	35137	35129	35129	You	80	" Armstrong said : "
35144	35152	35157	35157	you	80	" Blore turned crimson . He said : "
35165	35169	35162	35163	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Armstrong repeated : "
35178	35179	35162	35163	Dr. Armstrong	80	" "
35204	35210	35192	35192	your	92	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said : "
35223	35228	35218	35218	you	80	" Armstrong said hotly : "
35246	35253	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" Lombard said with a smile : "
35280	35287	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" Armstrong nodded . He said : "
35303	35308	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" The judge said : "
35319	35320	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" "
35325	35330	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" Philip Lombard said : "
35336	35342	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" The judge said evenly : "
35352	35369	35234	35234	Lombard	69	" He turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her lap . "
35373	35378	35383	35384	Miss Claythorne	121	" Emily Brent said : "
35402	35407	35383	35384	Miss Claythorne	121	" The judge said : "
35415	35416	35412	35412	you	80	" "
35438	35439	35412	35412	you	80	" "
35448	35449	35441	35441	you	80	" "
35452	35453	35441	35441	you	80	" "
35457	35464	35454	35455	Miss Claythorne	121	" Vera answered readily and clearly . "
35489	35498	35486	35487	General Macarthur	77	" Mr. Justice Wargrave interrupted . He said : "
35504	35516	35486	35487	General Macarthur	77	" Vera for the first time was vague . She said ; "
35535	35539	35486	35487	General Macarthur	77	" Blore asked : "
35551	35555	35486	35487	General Macarthur	77	" Vera said : "
35566	35570	35561	35561	he	77	" She shivered . "
35578	35592	35593	35593	He	77	" the judge wanted to know . Vera said in a low voice : "
35615	35623	35611	35611	he	77	" The judge nodded . He said : "
35630	35631	35611	35611	he	77	" "
35661	35672	35653	35653	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave stroked his chin . He said : "
35691	35821	35680	35680	his	77	" Rogers , summoned before the court , had very little to tell . He had been busy all the morning about household duties and with the preparation of lunch . He had taken cocktails onto the terrace before lunch and had then gone up to remove his things from the attic to another room . He had not looked out of the window during the morning and had seen nothing that could have any bearing upon the death of General Macarthur . He would swear definitely that there had been eight china figures upon the diningtable when he laid the table for lunch . At the conclusion of Rogers ' evidence there was a pause . Mr. Justice Wargrave cleared his throat . Lombard murmured to Vera Claythorne : "
35830	35835	35836	35836	We	1165	" The judge said : "
35974	36059	36060	36061	Philip Lombard	69	" would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any suggestions that may occur to you . In the meantime warn everybody to be upon his or her guard . So far the murderer has had an easy task , since his victims have been unsuspicious . From now on , it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst us . Forewarned is forearmed . Take no risks and be alert to danger . That is all . "
36067	36074	36064	36064	his	69	" The court will now adjourn ... "
36075	36081	36082	36082	Vera	121	" Do you believe it ? "
36130	36150	36127	36127	he	69	" You mean , do believe that old Wargrave is right when he says it 's one of us ? "
36151	36154	36155	36156	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes . "
36160	36178	36155	36156	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's difficult to say . Logically , you know , he 's right , and yet "
36188	36196	36179	36179	Vera	121	" And yet it seems so incredible ! "
36203	36246	36197	36198	Philip Lombard	69	" The whole thing 's incredible ! But after Macarthur 's death there 's no more doubt as to one thing . There 's no question now of accidents or suicides . It 's definitely murder . Three murders up to date . "
36253	36271	36250	36250	She	121	" It 's like some awful dream . keep feeling that things like this ca n't happen ! "
36277	36298	36272	36272	He	69	" know . Presently a tap will come on the door , and early morning tea will be brought in . "
36302	36311	36299	36299	Vera	121	" Oh , how wish that could happen ! "
36317	36347	36312	36313	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes , but it wo n't ! We 're all in the dream ! And we 've got to be pretty much upon our guard from now on . "
36355	36370	36352	36352	her	121	" If if it is one of them which do you think it is ? "
36379	36447	36376	36376	He	69	" take it you are excepting our two selves ? Well , that 's all right . know very well that I 'm not the murderer , and do n't fancy that there 's anything insane about you , Vera . You strike me as being one of the sanest and most levelheaded girls I 've come across . I 'd stake my reputation on your sanity . "
36457	36461	36454	36454	Vera	121	" Thank you . "
36465	36482	36462	36462	He	69	" Come now , Miss Vera Claythorne , are n't you going to return the compliment ? "
36492	36528	36489	36489	she	121	" You 've admitted , you know , that you do n't hold human life particularly sacred , but all the same ca n't see you as as the man who dictated that gramophone record . "
36532	36608	36529	36529	Lombard	69	" Quite right . If were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what could get out of them . This mass clearance is n't my line of country . Good , then we 'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners . Which of them is U.N. Owen ? Well , at a guess , and with absolutely nothing to go upon , I 'd plump for Wargrave ! "
36609	36612	36613	36613	Vera	121	" Oh ! "
36627	36630	36617	36617	She	121	" Why ? "
36631	36729	36730	36730	Vera	121	" Hard to say exactly . But to begin with , he 's an old man and he 's been presiding over courts of law for years . That is to say , he 's played God Almighty for a good many months every year . That must go to a man 's head eventually . He gets to see himself as all powerful , as holding the power of life and death and it 's possible that his brain might snap and he might want to go one step farther and be Executioner and Judge Extraordinary . "
36734	36742	36730	36730	Vera	121	" Yes , suppose that 's possible ... "
36746	36753	36743	36743	Lombard	69	" Who do you plump for ? "
36760	36764	36757	36757	Vera	121	" Dr. Armstrong . "
36771	36788	36765	36765	Lombard	69	" The doctor , eh ? You know , should have put him last of all . "
36794	36843	36844	36844	Lombard	69	" Oh , no ! Two of the deaths have been poison . That rather points to a doctor . And then you ca n't get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain Mrs. Rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave her . "
36847	36854	36844	36844	Lombard	69	" Yes , that 's true . "
36858	36886	36855	36855	Vera	121	" If a doctor went mad , it would be a long time before any one suspected . And doctors overwork and have a lot of strain . "
36891	36949	36887	36888	Philip Lombard	69	" Yes but doubt if he could have killed Macarthur . He would n't have had time during that brief interval when left him not , that is , unless he fairly hared down there and back again , and doubt if he 's in good enough training to do that and show no signs of it . "
36953	36967	36950	36950	Vera	121	" He did n't do it then . He had an opportunity later . "
36968	36971	36985	36985	Philip	69	" When ? "
36972	36984	36985	36985	Philip	69	" When he went down to call the General to lunch . "
36994	37009	36991	36991	He	69	" So you think he did it then ? Pretty cool thing to do . "
37014	37049	37010	37010	Vera	121	" What risk was there ? He 's the only person here with medical knowledge . He can swear the body 's been dead at least an hour and who 's to contradict him ? "
37056	37060	37061	37061	he	69	" You know , "
37064	37074	37061	37061	he	69	" that 's a clever idea of yours . wonder "
37075	37094	37095	37095	Rogers	89	" Who is it , Mr. Blore ? That 's what want to know . Who is it ? "
37120	37131	37116	37117	Exinspector Blore	153	" Eh , my lad , that 's the question ! "
37132	37161	37095	37095	Rogers	89	" One of us , ' is lordship said . Which one ? That 's what want to know . Who 's the fiend in ' uman form ? "
37162	37165	37167	37167	Blore	88	" That , "
37169	37179	37180	37180	Rogers	89	" is what we all would like to know . "
37184	37205	37180	37180	Rogers	89	" But you 've got an idea , Mr. Blore . You 've got an idea , ' aven't you ? "
37206	37212	37214	37214	Blore	88	" may have an idea , "
37217	37256	37257	37257	Rogers	89	" But that 's a long way from being sure . may be wrong . All can say is that if I 'm right the person in question is a very cool customer a very cool customer indeed . "
37269	37283	37284	37284	Blore	88	" It 's like a bad dream , that 's what it is . "
37292	37300	37284	37284	Blore	88	" Got any ideas yourself , Rogers ? "
37311	37339	37307	37307	He	455	" do n't know . do n't know at all . And that 's what 's frightening the life out of me . To have no idea ... "
37345	37361	37340	37341	Dr. Armstrong	80	" We must get out of here we must we must ! At all costs ! "
37385	37432	37382	37382	He	53	" do not , of course , profess to be a weather prophet . But should say that it is very unlikely that a boat could reach us even if they knew of our plight under twentyfour hours and even then only if the wind drops . "
37447	37461	37444	37444	He	53	" And in the meantime we may all be murdered in our beds ? "
37462	37466	37468	37470	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" hope not , "
37472	37485	37468	37470	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" intend to take every possible precaution against such a thing happening . "
37555	37577	37549	37551	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Murdered in our beds ! These doctors are all the same they think in clichns . A thoroughly commonplace mind . "
37582	37592	37578	37579	The doctor	285	" There have been three victims already , remember . "
37593	37612	37613	37614	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Certainly . But you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack . We are forewarned . "
37618	37627	37613	37614	Dr. Armstrong	80	" What can we do ? Sooner or later "
37628	37631	37633	37635	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" think , "
37637	37647	37648	37648	Armstrong	80	" that there are several things we can do . "
37651	37663	37648	37648	Armstrong	80	" We 've no idea , even , who it can be "
37672	37684	37664	37665	The judge	336	" Oh , you know , would n't quite say that . "
37690	37697	37685	37685	Armstrong	80	" Do you mean you know ? "
37704	37747	37698	37700	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" As regards actual evidence , such as is necessary in court , admit that have none . But it appears to me , reviewing the whole business , that one particular person is sufficiently clearly indicated . Yes , think so . "
37756	37761	37753	37753	He	80	" do n't understand . "
37826	37911	37819	37819	She	74	" A terrible thing has happened . General Macarthur is dead . ( His cousin married Elsie MacPherson . ) There is no doubt but that he was murdered . After luncheon the judge made us a most interesting speech . He is convinced that the murderer is one of us . That means that one of us is possessed by a devil . had already suspected that . Which of us is it ? They are all asking themselves that . alone know ... "
37994	38007	37987	37987	She	74	" Did write that ? Did I ? must be going mad ... "
38058	38072	38055	38055	He	1190	" Shall draw the curtains ? It would make it more cheerful like . "
38126	38136	38122	38123	Vera Claythorne	121	" Will you pour out tea , Miss Brent ? "
38142	38170	38137	38139	The elder woman	1194	" No , you do it , dear . That teapot is so heavy . And have lost two skeins of my grey knittingwool . So annoying . "
38246	38265	38239	38239	He	1190	" Excuse me , sir , but does any one know what 's become of the bathroom curtain ? "
38275	38289	38266	38266	Lombard	69	" The bathroom curtain ? What the devil do you mean , Rogers ? "
38290	38320	38321	38323	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" It 's gone , sir , clean vanished . was going round drawing all the curtains and the one in the lav bathroom was n't there any longer . "
38326	38333	38321	38323	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Was it there this morning ? "
38334	38341	38342	38342	Blore	88	" Oh , yes , sir . "
38345	38354	38342	38342	Blore	88	" What kind of a curtain was it ? "
38355	38368	38369	38369	Lombard	69	" Scarlet oilsilk , sir . It went with the scarlet tiles . "
38372	38378	38369	38369	Lombard	69	" And it 's gone ? "
38379	38384	38385	38385	They	1195	" Gone , sir . "
38395	38433	38391	38391	Blore	88	" Well after all what of it ? It 's mad but so 's everything else . Anyway , it does n't matter . You ca n't kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain . Forget about it . "
38437	38447	38448	38448	He	1197	" Yes , sir , thank you , sir . "
38528	38535	38525	38525	She	74	" I 'm going to bed . "
38539	38547	38536	38536	Vera	121	" I 'll go to bed too . "
38609	38620	38603	38603	Blore	88	" No need to tell 'em to lock their doors ! "
38624	38639	38621	38621	Lombard	69	" Well , they 're all right for the night , at any rate ! "
38700	38713	38694	38695	the judge	336	" need hardly advise you , gentlemen , to lock your doors . "
38717	38741	38714	38714	Blore	88	" And , what 's more , put a chair under the handle . There are ways of turning locks from the outside . "
38745	38760	38742	38742	Lombard	69	" My dear Blore , the trouble with you is you know too much ! "
38766	38780	38761	38762	The judge	336	" Goodnight , gentlemen . May we all meet safely in the morning ! "
38821	38827	38828	38828	he	69	" That 's all right , "
38873	38887	38870	38870	He	69	" I 'll see no one plays tricks tonight , at any rate . "
38979	38991	38974	38974	He	69	" No more Indian tricks tonight I 've seen to that ... "
39105	39117	39100	39100	He	69	" think the time has come to do something about this . "
39159	39175	39154	39155	Philip Lombard	69	" Sleeping the clock round ? Well , shows you 've got an easy conscience . "
39180	39186	39176	39176	Blore	88	" What 's the matter ? "
39190	39208	39187	39187	Lombard	69	" Anybody called you or brought you any tea ? Do you know what time it is ? "
39226	39245	39223	39223	He	88	" Twentyfive to ten . Would n't have believed could have slept like that . Where 's Rogers ? "
39250	39260	39246	39247	Philip Lombard	69	" It 's a case of echo answers where ? "
39261	39266	39272	39272	Lombard	69	" What d'you mean ? "
39275	39307	39272	39272	Lombard	69	" mean that Rogers is missing . He is n't in his room or anywhere else . And there 's no kettle on and the kitchen fire is n't even lit . "
39317	39345	39314	39314	He	88	" Where the devil can he be ? Out on the island somewhere ? Wait till get some clothes on . See if the others know anything . "
39435	39442	39432	39432	Lombard	69	" He got up all right . "
39458	39471	39443	39443	Vera	121	" You do n't think he 's hiding somewhere waiting for us ? "
39475	39502	39472	39472	Lombard	69	" My dear girl , I 'm prepared to think anything of any one ! My advice is that we keep together until we find him . "
39506	39516	39503	39503	Armstrong	80	" He must be out on the island somewhere . "
39531	39543	39517	39517	Blore	88	" Where 's Miss Brent got to that 's another mystery ? "
39570	39589	39567	39567	She	74	" The sea is as high as ever . should n't think any boat could put out today . "
39593	39620	39590	39590	Blore	88	" Have you been wandering about the island alone , Miss Brent ? Do n't you realize that that 's an exceedingly foolish thing to do ? "
39625	39639	39640	39640	Blore	88	" assure you , Mr. Blore , that kept an extremely sharp lookout . "
39646	39652	39643	39643	He	88	" Seen anything of Rogers ? "
39659	39673	39653	39654	Miss Brent	74	" Rogers ? No , have n't seen him this morning . Why ? "
39705	39715	39702	39702	He	53	" He laid the table for breakfast , see . "
39719	39728	39716	39716	Lombard	69	" He might have done that last night . "
39796	39802	39792	39792	She	121	" The Indians ! Look ! "
39893	39897	39899	39899	Armstrong	80	" Perfectly clear , "
39901	39928	39899	39899	Armstrong	80	" The murderer must have crept up behind him , swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending over . "
39951	39961	39962	39962	Armstrong	80	" Would it have needed great force , doctor ? "
39966	39980	39962	39962	Armstrong	80	" A woman could have done it if that 's what you mean . "
39999	40053	40054	40055	The judge	336	" The girl could have done it easily she 's an athletic type . In appearance Miss Brent is fragile looking , but that type of woman has often a lot of wiry strength . And you must remember that any one who 's mentally unhinged has a good deal of unsuspected strength . "
40071	40080	40068	40068	He	88	" No fingerprints . Handle was wiped afterwards . "
40115	40139	40099	40099	She	121	" Do they keep bees on this island ? Tell me that . Where do we go for honey ? Ha ! ha ! "
40170	40299	40161	40161	She	121	" Do n't stare like that ! As though you thought was mad . It 's sane enough what I 'm asking . Bees , hives , bees ! Oh , do n't you understand ? Have n't you read that idiotic rhyme ? It 's up in all your bedrooms put there for you to study ! We might have come here straightaway if we 'd had sense . Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks . And the next verse . know the whole thing by heart , tell you ! Six little Indian boys playing with a hive . And that 's why I 'm asking do they keep bees on this island ? is n't it funny ? is n't it damned funny ... ? "
40342	40352	40339	40339	she	121	" Thank you ... I 'm all right now . "
40381	40400	40369	40369	She	121	" Miss Brent and are getting you breakfast . Can you bring some sticks to light the fire ? "
40424	40436	40421	40421	Blore	88	" Well , you dealt with that all right , doctor . "
40441	40458	40437	40437	Armstrong	80	" Had to ! We ca n't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else . "
40463	40471	40459	40460	Philip Lombard	69	" She 's not a hysterical type . "
40475	40496	40472	40472	Armstrong	80	" Oh , no . Good healthy sensible girl . Just the sudden shock . It might happen to anybody . "
40550	40577	40546	40547	Emily Brent	74	" Thank you . We 'll be as quick as we can say half an hour to three quarters . The kettle 's got to boil . "
40590	40597	40579	40579	Blore	88	" Know what I 'm thinking ? "
40602	40621	40598	40599	Philip Lombard	69	" As you 're just about to tell me , it 's not worth the trouble of guessing . "
40642	40714	40715	40715	He	153	" There was a case in America . Old gentleman and his wife both killed with an axe . Middle of the morning . Nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid . Maid , it was proved , could n't have done it . Daughter was a respectable middleaged spinster . Seemed incredible . So incredible that they acquitted her . But they never found any other explanation . "
40718	40773	40715	40715	He	153	" thought of that when saw the axe and then when went into the kitchen and saw her there so neat and calm . Had n't turned a hair ! That girl , coming all over hysterical well , that 's natural the sort of thing you 'd expect do n't you think so ? "
40779	40784	40774	40775	Philip Lombard	69	" It might be . "
40789	40898	40785	40785	Blore	88	" But the other ! So neat and prim wrapped up in that apron Mrs. Rogers ' apron , suppose saying : ' Breakfast will be ready in half an hour or so . ' If you ask me that woman 's as mad as a hatter ! Lots of elderly spinsters go that way do n't mean go in for homicide on the grand scale , but go queer in their heads . Unfortunately it 's taken her this way . Religious mania thinks she 's God 's instrument , something of that kind ! She sits in her room , you know , reading her Bible . "
40905	40918	40899	40900	Philip Lombard	69	" That 's hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality , Blore . "
40928	40949	40920	40920	Blore	88	" And then she was out in her mackintosh , said she 'd been down to look at the sea . "
40959	41016	40956	40956	He	230	" Rogers was killed as he was chopping firewood that is to say first thing when he got up . The Brent woman would n't have needed to wander about outside for hours afterwards . If you ask me , the murderer of Rogers would take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoring . "
41020	41074	41017	41017	Blore	88	" You 're missing the point , Mr. Lombard . If the woman was innocent she 'd be too dead scared to go wandering about by herself . She 'd only do that if she knew that she had nothing to fear . That 's to say if she herself is the criminal . "
41079	41094	41095	41095	He	69	" That 's a good point ... Yes , had n't thought of that . "
41102	41111	41112	41112	Blore	88	" Glad you do n't still suspect me . "
41117	41151	41152	41152	He	88	" did start by thinking of you that revolver and the queer story you told or did n't tell . But I 've realized now that that was really a bit too obvious , "
41157	41166	41152	41152	He	88	" Hope you feel the same about me . "
41171	41218	41219	41219	He	69	" may be wrong , of course , but ca n't feel that you 've got enough imagination for this job . All can say is , if you 're the criminal , you 're a damned fine actor and take my hat off to you . "
41224	41262	41221	41221	his	69	" Just between ourselves , Blore , and taking into account that we 'll probably both be a couple of stiffs before another day is out , you did indulge in that spot of perjury , suppose ? "
41278	41326	41273	41273	He	88	" Does n't seem to make much odds now . Oh , well , here goes . Landor was innocent right enough . The gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away for a stretch . Mind you , would n't admit this "
41327	41334	41336	41336	Lombard	69	" If there were any witnesses , "
41341	41362	41336	41336	Lombard	69	" It 's just between you and me . Well , hope you made a tidy bit out of it . "
41363	41385	41273	41273	He	88	" Did n't make what should have done . Mean crowd , the Purcell gang . got my promotion , though . "
41386	41397	41273	41273	He	88	" And Landor got penal servitude and died in prison . "
41398	41411	41413	41413	Blore	88	" could n't know he was going to die , could I ? "
41415	41424	41413	41413	Blore	88	" No , that was your bad luck . "
41425	41433	41273	41273	He	88	" Mine ? His , you mean . "
41434	41462	41273	41273	He	88	" Yours , too . Because , as a result of it , it looks as though your own life is going to be cut unpleasantly short . "
41463	41466	41413	41413	Blore	88	" Me ? "
41472	41507	41508	41508	Lombard	69	" Do you think I 'm going to go the way of Rogers and the rest of them ? Not me ! I 'm watching out for myself pretty carefully , can tell you . "
41511	41533	41508	41508	Lombard	69	" Oh , well I 'm not a betting man . And anyway if you were dead would n't get paid . "
41534	41546	41547	41548	Philip Lombard	69	" Look here , Mr. Lombard , what do you mean ? "
41556	41574	41553	41553	He	69	" mean , my dear Blore , that in my opinion you have n't got a chance ! "
41575	41578	41642	41642	He	69	" What ? "
41579	41615	41616	41616	Blore	88	" Your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target . A criminal of the imagination of U.N. Owen can make rings round you any time he or she wants to . "
41626	41632	41622	41622	He	69	" And what about you ? "
41645	41687	41642	41642	He	69	" I 've a pretty good imagination of my own . I 've been in tight places before now and got out of them ! think wo n't say more than that but think I 'll get out of this one . "
41705	41729	41695	41695	Vera	121	" Why did make a hysterical fool of myself ? That was a mistake . Keep calm , my girl , keep calm . "
41742	41758	41733	41733	she	121	" Miss Claythorne was wonderful kept her head started off swimming after Cyril at once . "
41867	41875	41862	41863	Emily Brent	74	" Vera , that bacon is burning . "
41876	41893	41894	41895	Emily Brent	74	" Oh , sorry , Miss Brent , so it is . How stupid of me . "
41920	41929	41906	41906	Vera	121	" You 're wonderfully calm , Miss Brent . "
41939	41954	41930	41931	Emily Brent	74	" was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fuss . "
41959	41971	41972	41972	She	121	" Repressed as a child ... That accounts for a lot ... "
41975	41981	41972	41972	She	121	" Are n't you afraid ? "
41988	41996	41982	41982	She	121	" Or do n't you mind dying ? "
42111	42120	42104	42104	she	74	" The Lord is mindful of his own . "
42121	42142	42061	42062	her people	1261	" Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ... "
42152	42296	42061	42062	her people	1261	" We shall none of us leave this island ... Who had said that ? General Macarthur , of course , whose cousin had married Elsie MacPherson . He had n't seemed to care . He had seemed actually to welcome the idea ! Wicked ! Almost impious to feel that way . Some people thought so little of death that they actually took their own lives . Beatrice Taylor ... Last night she had dreamed of Beatrice dreamt that she was outside pressing her face against the window and moaning , asking to be let in . But Emily Brent had n't wanted to let her in . Because , if she did , something terrible would happen ... Emily came to herself with a start . That girl was looking at her very strangely . She said in a brisk voice : "
42312	42325	42305	42305	We	1264	" Breakfast was a curious meal . Every one was very polite . "
42336	42337	42333	42334	Miss Brent	74	" "
42346	42347	42338	42339	Miss Claythorne	121	" "
42353	42379	42338	42339	Miss Claythorne	121	" Six people , all outwardly selfpossessed and normal . And within ? Thoughts that ran round in a circle like squirrels in a cage ... "
42390	42391	42338	42339	Miss Claythorne	121	" "
42416	42417	42408	42409	My God	2091	" "

42477	42478	42479	42481	The damned fool	675	" "
42504	42523	42564	42564	his	53	" Six of those little china figures ... only six how many will there be by tonight ? ... "
42524	42532	42564	42564	his	53	" Who 'll have the last egg ? "
42533	42536	42564	42564	his	53	" Marmalade ? "
42537	42546	42564	42564	his	53	" Thanks , can give you some ham ? "
42575	42604	42567	42567	He	53	" It would be advisable , think , if we met to discuss the situation . Shall we say in half an hour 's time in the drawingroom ? "
42624	42633	42621	42621	She	121	" I 'll clear away and wash up . "
42638	42651	42634	42635	Philip Lombard	69	" We 'll bring the stuff out to the pantry for you . "
42652	42655	42656	42657	Emily Brent	74	" Thanks . "
42671	42676	42668	42668	She	74	" Oh , dear . "
42681	42689	42677	42678	The judge	336	" Anything the matter , Miss Brent ? "
42694	42721	42690	42690	Emily	74	" I 'm sorry . I 'd like to help Miss Claythorne , but do n't know how it is . feel just a little giddy . "
42722	42727	42728	42729	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Giddy , eh ? "
42734	42746	42728	42729	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Quite natural . Delayed shock . can give you something to "
42747	42750	42755	42755	her	74	" No ! "
42791	42800	42787	42787	He	80	" Just as you please , Miss Brent . "
42804	42826	42801	42801	She	74	" do n't wish to take anything anything at all . will just sit here quietly till the giddiness passes off . "
42838	42857	42835	42835	Blore	88	" I 'm a domestic sort of man . I 'll give you a hand , Miss Claythorne . "
42861	42865	42858	42858	Vera	121	" Thank you . "
42929	42938	42926	42926	She	74	" It 's like a bee a bumblebee . "
43127	43134	43123	43124	Vera Claythorne	121	" Shall go and fetch her ? "
43139	43144	43135	43135	Blore	88	" Just a minute . "
43160	43203	43157	43157	He	88	" Look here , everybody , my opinion 's this : we need n't look farther for the author of these deaths than the diningroom at this minute . I 'd take my oath that woman 's the one we 're after ! "
43207	43212	43157	43157	He	88	" And the motive ? "
43213	43224	43225	43225	Armstrong	80	" Religious mania . What do you say , doctor ? "
43228	43250	43225	43225	Armstrong	80	" It 's perfectly possible . I 've nothing to say against it . But of course we 've no proof . "
43254	43270	43271	43271	She	121	" She was very odd in the kitchen when we were getting breakfast . Her eyes "
43277	43297	43274	43274	Lombard	69	" You ca n't judge her by that . We 're all a bit off our heads by now ! "
43301	43333	43298	43298	Blore	88	" There 's another thing . She 's the only one who would n't give an explanation after that gramophone record . Why ? Because she had n't any to give . "
43343	43355	43340	43340	She	121	" That 's not quite true . She told me afterwards . "
43359	43369	43356	43356	Wargrave	53	" What did she tell you , Miss Claythorne ? "
43383	43427	43378	43380	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" A perfectly straightforward story . personally should have no difficulty in accepting it . Tell me , Miss Claythorne , did she appear to be troubled by a sense of guilt or a feeling of remorse for her attitude in the matter ? "
43428	43432	43434	43434	Vera	121	" None whatever , "
43436	43442	43443	43443	Blore	88	" She was completely unmoved . "
43446	43461	43443	43443	Blore	88	" Hearts as hard as flints , these righteous spinsters ! Envy , mostly ! "
43467	43487	43462	43464	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" It is now five minutes to eleven . think we should summon Miss Brent to join our conclave . "
43491	43501	43488	43488	Blore	88	" Are n't you going to take any action ? "
43506	43551	43502	43503	The judge	336	" fail to see what action we can take . Our suspicions are , at the moment , only suspicions . will , however , ask Dr. Armstrong to observe Miss Brent 's demeanour very carefully . Let us now go into the diningroom . "
43608	43616	43605	43605	Blore	88	" My God , she 's dead ! "
43627	43636	43622	43624	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" One more of us acquitted too late ! "
43663	43681	43659	43659	Lombard	69	" How did she die , doctor ? She was all right when we left her here ! "
43701	43711	43698	43698	He	80	" That 's the mark of a hypodermic syringe . "
43724	43737	43721	43721	Vera	121	" Look a bee a bumblebee . Remember what said this morning ! "
43742	43759	43738	43738	Armstrong	80	" It was n't that bee that stung her ! A human hand held the syringe . "
43764	43770	43771	43771	Armstrong	80	" What poison was injected ? "
43774	43802	43771	43771	Armstrong	80	" At a guess , one of the cyanides . Probably Potassium Cyanide , same as Anthony Marston . She must have died almost immediately by asphyxiation . "
43806	43817	43803	43803	Vera	121	" But that bee ? It ca n't be coincidence ? "
43822	43861	43818	43818	Lombard	69	" Oh , no , it is n't coincidence ! It 's our murderer 's touch of local colour ! He 's a playful beast . Likes to stick to his damnable nursery jingle as closely as possible ' "
43903	43915	43899	43899	He	69	" It 's mad ! absolutely mad we 're all mad ! "
43921	43943	43916	43917	The judge	336	" We have still , hope , our reasoning powers . Did any one bring a hypodermic syringe to this house ? "
43961	43966	43948	43948	himself	80	" Yes , did . "
43990	44000	43987	43987	He	80	" Always travel with one . Most doctors do . "
44007	44024	44001	44003	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" Quite so . Will you tell us , doctor , where that syringe is now ? "
44025	44033	44034	44034	Wargrave	53	" In the suitcase in my room . "
44037	44047	44034	44034	Wargrave	53	" We might , perhaps , verify that fact . "
44082	44089	44078	44078	Armstrong	80	" Somebody must have taken it ! "
44131	44141	44120	44120	He	80	" tell you some one must have taken it . "
44156	44214	44152	44153	The judge	336	" There are five of us here in this room . One of us is a murderer . The position is fraught with grave danger . Everything must be done in order to safeguard the four of us who are innocent . will now ask you , Dr. Armstrong , what drugs you have in your possession ? "
44218	44262	44215	44215	Armstrong	80	" have a small medicine case here . You can examine it . You will find some sleeping stuff trional and sulphonal tablets a packet of bromide , bicarbonate of soda , aspirin . Nothing else . have no cyanide in my possession . "
44267	44306	44263	44264	The judge	336	" have , myself , some sleeping tablets sulphonal , think they are . presume they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given . You , Mr. Lombard , have in your possession a revolver . "
44312	44317	44307	44308	Philip Lombard	69	" What if have ? "
44318	44383	44384	44384	Lombard	69	" Only this . propose that the doctor 's supply of drugs , my own sulphonal tablets , your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms should be collected together and placed in a safe place . That after this is done , we should each of us submit to a search both of our persons and of our effects . "
44387	44399	44384	44384	Lombard	69	" I 'm damned if I 'll give up my revolver ! "
44404	44494	44400	44400	Wargrave	53	" Mr. Lombard , you are a very strongly built and powerful young man , but ex Inspector Blore is also a man of powerful physique . do not know what the outcome of a struggle between you would be but can tell you this . On Blore 's side , assisting him to the best of our ability will be myself , Dr. Armstrong and Miss Claythorne . You will appreciate , therefore , that the odds against you if you choose to resist will be somewhat heavy . "
44511	44527	44501	44501	His	69	" Oh , very well then . Since you 've got it all taped out . "
44535	44550	44532	44532	his	53	" You are a sensible young man . Where is this revolver of yours ? "
44551	44562	44501	44501	His	69	" In the drawer of the table by my bed . "
44565	44571	44532	44532	his	53	" I 'll fetch it . "
44572	44584	44585	44585	Philip	69	" think it would be desirable if we went with you . "
44597	44605	44585	44585	Philip	69	" Suspicious devil , are n't you ? "
44643	44646	44648	44648	Lombard	69	" Satisfied ? "
44718	44751	44752	44752	Vera	121	" hope you will understand . Miss Claythorne , that we can make no exceptions . That revolver must be found . You have , presume , a bathing dress with you ? "
44755	44777	44752	44752	Vera	121	" Then will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us here . "
44807	44827	44803	44803	Wargrave	53	" Thank you , Miss Claythorne . Now if you will remain here , we will search your room . "
44858	44919	44854	44855	The judge	336	" We are now assured of one thing . There are no lethal weapons or drugs in the possession of any of us five . That is one point to the good . We will now place the drugs in a safe place . There is , think , a silver chest , is there not , in the pantry ? "
44923	44942	44920	44920	Blore	150	" That 's all very well , but who 's to have the key ? You , suppose . "
45043	45114	45040	45040	He	336	" You two are the strongest physically . It would be difficult for either of you to get the key from the other . It would be impossible for any of us three to do so . To break open the cupboard or the plate chest would be a noisy and cumbrous proceeding and one which could hardly be carried out without attention being attracted to what was going on . "
45122	45142	45115	45115	He	336	" We are still faced by one very grave problem . What has become of Mr. Lombard 's revolver ? "
45146	45161	45143	45143	Blore	150	" Seems to me its owner is the most likely person to know that . "
45175	45190	45172	45172	He	336	" You damned pigheaded fool ! tell you it 's been stolen from me ! "
45194	45202	45191	45191	Wargrave	53	" When did you see it last ? "
45203	45222	45223	45224	The judge	336	" Last night . It was in the drawer when went to bed ready in case anything happened . "
45230	45253	45227	45227	He	336	" It must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for Rogers or after his dead body was discovered . "
45257	45273	45254	45254	Vera	121	" It must be hidden somewhere about the house . We must look for it . "
45287	45319	45284	45284	He	53	" doubt if our search will result in anything . Our murderer has had plenty of time to devise a hidingplace . do not fancy we shall find that revolver easily . "
45324	45349	45320	45320	Blore	150	" do n't know where the revolver is , but I 'll bet know where something else is that hypodermic syringe . Follow me . "
45396	45433	45389	45389	Blore	150	" Only place it could be . After he 'd killed her , he opened the window and threw out the syringe and picked up the china figure from the table and followed on with that . "
45455	45464	45448	45448	Vera	121	" Now let us look for the revolver . "
45470	45499	45465	45467	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" By all means . But in doing so let us be careful to keep together . Remember , if we separate , the murderer gets his chance . "
45520	45533	45551	45553	five frightened people	1326	" One of us ... One of us ... One of us ... "
45867	45899	45900	45900	Blore	153	" We we should n't just sit here doing nothing ! There must be something surely , surely , there is something that we can do ? If we lit a bonfire "
45904	45909	45900	45900	Blore	153	" In this weather ? "
45978	46004	45975	45975	Lombard	69	" It 's only a question of time . The weather will clear . Then we can do something signallight fires make a raft something ! "
46014	46033	46005	46005	Armstrong	80	" A question of time time ? We ca n't afford time ! We shall all be dead ... "
46050	46063	46040	46040	his	53	" Not if we are careful . We must be very careful ... "
46163	46287	46629	46629	She	121	" It 's Armstrong ... saw him looking at me sideways just then ... his eyes are mad ... quite mad ... Perhaps he is n't a doctor at all ... That 's it , of course ! ... He 's a lunatic , escaped from some doctor 's house pretending to be a doctor ... It 's true ... shall tell them ? ... Shall scream out ? ... No , it wo n't do to put him on his guard ... Besides he can seem so sane ... What time is it ? ... Only a quarter past three ! ... Oh , God , shall go mad myself ... Yes , it 's Armstrong ... He 's watching me now ... "
46288	46354	46629	46629	She	121	" They wo n't get me ! can take care of myself ... I 've been in tight places before ... Where the hell is that revolver ? ... Who took it ? ... Who 's got it ? ... Nobody 's got it we know that . We were all searched ... Nobody can have it ... But some one knows where it is ... "
46355	46427	46629	46629	She	121	" They 're going mad ... they 're all go mad ... Afraid of death ... we 're all afraid of death ... I 'm afraid of death ... Yes , but that does n't stop death coming ... ' The hearse is at the door , sir . ' Where did read that ? The girl ... I 'll watch the girl . Yes , I 'll watch the girl ... "
46428	46528	46629	46629	She	121	" Twenty to four ... only twenty to four ... perhaps the clock has stopped ... do n't understand no , do n't understand ... This sort of thing ca n't happen ... it is happening ... Why do n't we wake up ? Wake up Judgement Day not that ! If could only think ... My head something 's happening in my head it 's going to burst it 's going to split ... This sort of thing ca n't happen ... What 's the time ? Oh , God ! it 's only a quarter to four . "
46529	46587	46629	46629	She	121	" must keep my head ... must keep my head ... If only keep my head ... It 's all perfectly clear all worked out . But nobody must suspect . It may do the trick . It must ! Which one ? That 's the question which one ? think yes , rather think yes him . "
46600	46607	46597	46597	Vera	121	" Does any one want tea ? "
46618	46625	46615	46615	Blore	153	" I 'd like a cup . "
46632	46646	46629	46629	She	121	" I 'll go and make it . You can all stay here . "
46653	46673	46647	46649	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" think , my dear young lady , we would all prefer to come and watch you make it . "
46688	46695	46685	46685	She	121	" Of course ! You would ! "
46740	46747	46732	46733	The judge	336	" We must be very careful ... "
46780	46802	46777	46777	He	69	" Of course ! The engine 's not been run today since Rogers has n't been there to see to it . "
46808	46820	46803	46803	He	69	" We could go out and get it going , suppose . "
46826	46843	46821	46823	Mr. Justice Wargrave	53	" There are packets of candles in the larder , saw them , better use those . "
47080	47091	47104	47108	Horrid whiny spoilt little brat	1366	" Can swim out to the island , Miss Claythorne ? "
47092	47103	47104	47108	Horrid whiny spoilt little brat	1366	" Why ca n't swim out to the island ? ... "
47180	47187	47191	47191	herself	121	" Do n't be a fool , "
47193	47230	47191	47191	herself	121	" It 's all right . The others are downstairs . All four of them . There 's no one in the room . There ca n't be . You 're imagining things , my girl . "
47370	47375	47364	47364	men	813	" What the devil ? "
47376	47381	47364	47364	men	813	" What 's happened ? "
47382	47390	47391	47391	She	121	" Good God , what is it ? "
47434	47442	47417	47418	some one	606	" My God , look at that ! "
47533	47547	47530	47530	She	121	" It was seaweed only seaweed and that 's what the smell was ... "
47640	47647	47636	47636	She	121	" Where did this come from ? "
47663	47669	47660	47660	He	153	" got it from downstairs . "
47673	47679	47670	47670	Vera	121	" wo n't drink it ... "
47696	47734	47691	47691	He	69	" Good for you , Vera ! You 've got your wits about you even if you have been scared half out of your life . I 'll get a fresh bottle that has n't been opened . "
47744	47757	47740	47740	Vera	121	" I 'm all right now . I 'll have some water . "
47799	47806	47795	47795	Blore	153	" That brandy 's all right . "
47810	47816	47807	47807	Armstrong	80	" How do you know ? "
47821	47839	47817	47817	Blore	153	" did n't put anything in it . That 's what you 're getting at , suppose . "
47843	47871	47840	47840	Armstrong	80	" I 'm not saying you did . You might have done it , or some one might have tampered with the bottle for just this emergency . "
47904	47916	47917	47917	He	69	" There you are , my girl . Absolutely no deception . "
47928	47946	47947	47947	Vera	121	" Lucky there 's a good supply of spirits in the house . Thoughtful of U.N. Owen . "
47966	47983	47963	47963	He	69	" You 'd better drink this , Miss Claythorne . You 've had a nasty shock . "
48007	48022	48000	48001	Philip Lombard	69	" Well , here 's one murder that has n't gone according to plan ! "
48030	48039	48023	48023	Vera	121	" You think that was what was meant ? "
48043	48063	48040	48040	Lombard	69	" Expected you to pass out through fright ! Some people would have , would n't they , doctor ? "
48074	48094	48070	48070	He	80	" H'm , impossible to say . Young healthy subject no cardiac weakness . Unlikely . On the other hand "
48128	48135	48124	48124	He	80	" H'm , tastes all right . "
48144	48162	48141	48141	He	153	" If you 're saying that tampered with that , I 'll knock your ruddy block off . "
48178	48184	48163	48163	Vera	121	" Where 's the judge ? "
48193	48205	48190	48191	each other	323	" That 's odd ... Thought he came up with us . "
48209	48228	48206	48206	Blore	153	" So did I ... What about it , doctor ? You came up the stairs behind me . "
48232	48259	48229	48229	Armstrong	80	" thought he was following me ... Of course , he 'd be bound to go slower than we did . He 's an old man . "
48270	48276	48267	48267	Lombard	69	" It 's damned odd ... "
48280	48287	48288	48288	He	153	" We must look for him . "
48314	48325	48308	48308	Armstrong	80	" Of course he may have stayed in the livingroom ... "
48336	48345	48331	48331	Armstrong	80	" Wargrave , Wargrave , where are you ? "
48558	48564	48545	48545	He	80	" He 's been shot ... "
48568	48573	48574	48575	The doctor	285	" God the revolver ! "
48585	48594	48574	48575	The doctor	285	" Got him through the head . Instantaneous . "
48611	48619	48601	48601	She	121	" Miss Brent 's missing grey wool ... "
48623	48635	48620	48620	Blore	153	" And the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroom ... "
48639	48649	48636	48636	Vera	121	" So this is what they wanted them for ... "
48660	48747	48748	48748	His	1399	" Five little Indian boys going in for law ; one got in Chancery and then there were four . ' That 's the end of Mr. Bloody Justice Wargrave . No more pronouncing sentence for him ! No more putting on of the black cap ! Here 's the last time he 'll ever sit in court ! No more summing up and sending innocent men to death . How Edward Seton would laugh if he were here ! God , how he 'd laugh ! "
48759	48770	48756	48756	Vera	121	" Only this morning you said he was the one ! "
48785	48808	48778	48778	He	69	" know did ... Well , was wrong . Here 's one more of us who 's been proved innocent too late ! "
48847	48854	48843	48843	Blore	153	" What do we do now ? "
48859	48874	48855	48855	Lombard	69	" Have something to eat . We 've got to eat , you know . "
48902	48909	48899	48899	Vera	121	" shall never eat tongue again . "
48929	48942	48926	48926	Blore	153	" Only four of us now ... Who 'll be the next ? "
48952	48958	48946	48946	He	80	" We must be very careful "
48965	48978	48962	48962	Blore	153	" That 's what he said ... And now he 's dead ! "
48982	48990	48979	48979	Armstrong	80	" How did it happen , wonder ? "
48997	49049	48994	48994	He	69	" A damned clever double cross ! That stuff was planted in Miss Claythorne 's room and it worked just as it was intended to . Every one dashes up there thinking she 's being murdered . And so in the confusion some one caught the old boy off his guard . "
49053	49063	49050	49050	Blore	153	" Why did n't any one hear the shot ? "
49069	49096	49097	49097	He	69	" Miss Claythorne was screaming , the wind was howling , we were running about and calling out . No , it would n't be heard . "
49100	49121	49097	49097	He	69	" But that trick 's not going to work again . He 'll have to try something else next time . "
49125	49130	49122	49122	Blore	153	" He probably will . "
49150	49162	49147	49147	Armstrong	80	" Four of us , and we do n't know which ... "
49166	49169	49163	49163	Blore	153	" know ... "
49173	49180	49170	49170	Vera	121	" have n't the least doubt ... "
49185	49191	49181	49181	Armstrong	80	" suppose do know really ... "
49196	49207	49192	49193	Philip Lombard	69	" think I 've got a pretty good idea now ... "
49225	49239	49222	49222	She	121	" feel awful . must go to bed ... I 'm dead beat . "
49243	49255	49240	49240	Lombard	69	" Might as well . No good sitting watching each other . "
49259	49265	49256	49256	Blore	153	" I 've no objection ... "
49270	49285	49266	49267	The doctor	285	" The best thing to do although doubt if any of us will sleep . "
49295	49304	49292	49292	Blore	153	" wonder where that revolver is now ? ... "
49429	49441	49423	49423	He	69	" Yes , this business has got you rattled all right . "
49533	49569	49526	49526	She	121	" You 're all right until morning . Nothing happened last night . Nothing will happen tonight . Nothing can happen . You 're locked and bolted in . No one can come near you ... "
49575	49612	49571	49571	she	121	" Of course ! can stay here ! Stay here locked in ! Food does n't really matter ! can stay here safely till help comes ! Even if it 's a day or two days ... "
49668	49686	49689	49689	her	121	" Miss Claythorne , why ca n't swim out to the rock ? can . know can . "
49695	49708	49689	49689	her	121	" Of course you can , Cyril , really . know that . "
49709	49717	49653	49653	she	121	" Can go then , Miss Claythorne ? "
49718	49790	49689	49689	her	121	" Well , you see , Cyril , your mother gets so nervous about you . I 'll tell you what . Tomorrow you can swim out to the rock . I 'll talk to your mother on the beach and distract her attention . And then , when she looks for you , there you 'll be standing on the rock waving to her ! It will be a surprise ! "
49791	49806	49807	49807	She	1422	" Oh , good egg , Miss Claythorne ! That will be a lark ! "
49858	49886	49854	49854	he	67	" Miss Claythorne said could ... Well , what of it ? One must take some risk ! If the worst happened she 'd brazen it out . "
49906	50233	49854	49854	he	67	" They 'd believe her all right . Cyril often told stories . He was an untruthful child . Cyril would know , of course . But that did n't matter ... And anyway nothing would go wrong . She 'd pretend to swim out after him . But she 'd arrive too late ... Nobody would ever suspect ... Had Hugo suspected ? Was that why he had looked at her in that queer faroff way ... ? Had Hugo known ? Was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly ? He had n't answered the one letter she had written to him ... Hugo ... Vera turned restlessly in bed . No , no , she must n't think of Hugo . It hurt too much ! That was all over , over and done with ... Hugo must be forgotten ... Why , this evening , had she suddenly felt that Hugo was in the room with her ? She stared up at the ceiling , stared at the big black hook in the middle of the room . She 'd never noticed that hook before . The seaweed had hung from that ... She shivered as she remembered that cold clammy touch on her neck ... She did n't like that hook on the ceiling . It drew your eyes , fascinated you ... a big black hook ... Exinspector Blore sat on the side of his bed . His small eyes , redrimmed and bloodshot , were alert in the solid mass of his face . He was like a wild boar waiting to charge . He felt no inclination to sleep . The menace was coming very near now ... Six out of ten ! For all his sagacity , for all his caution and astuteness , the old judge had gone the way of the rest . Blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction . "
50243	50244	50237	50239	the old geezer	1424	" "
50251	51454	50237	50239	the old geezer	1424	" Selfrighteous smug old hypocrite . Sitting up in court feeling like God Almighty . He 'd got his all right ... No more being careful for him . And now there were four of them . The girl , Lombard , Armstrong and himself . Very soon another of them would go ... But it would n't be William Henry Blore . He 'd see to that all right . ( But the revolver ... What about the revolver ? That was the disturbing factor the revolver ! ) Blore sat on his bed , his brow furrowed , his little eyes creased and puckered while he pondered the problem of the revolver ... In the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs . Midnight . He relaxed a little now even went so far as to lie down on his bed . But he did not undress . He lay there , thinking . Going over the whole business from the beginning , methodically , painstakingly , as he had been wo nt to do in his police officer days . It was thoroughness that paid in the end . The candle was burning down . Looking to see if the matches were within easy reach of his hand , he blew it out . Strangely enough , he found the darkness disquieting . It was as though a thousand ageold fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain . Faces floated in the air the judge 's face crowned with that mockery of grey wool the cold dead face of Mrs. Rogers the convulsed purple face of Anthony Marston ... Another face pale , spectacled , with a small strawcoloured moustache ... A face he had seen sometime or other but when ? Not on the island . No , much longer ago than that . Funny , that he could n't put a name to it ... Silly sort of face really fellow looked a bit of a mug . Of course ! It came to him with a real shock . Landor ! Odd to think he 'd completely forgotten what Landor looked like . Only yesterday he 'd been trying to recall the fellow 's face , and had n't been able to . And now here it was , every feature clear and distinct , as though he had seen it only yesterday ... Landor had had a wife a thin slip of a woman with a worried face . There 'd been a kid too , a girl about fourteen . For the first time , he wondered what had become of them ... ( The revolver . What had become of the revolver ? That was much more important ... ) The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was ... He did n't understand this revolver business ... Somebody in the house had got that revolver ... Downstairs a clock struck one . Blore 's thoughts were cut short . He sat up on the bed , suddenly alert . For he had heard a sound a very faint sound somewhere outside his bedroom door . There was some one moving about in the darkened house . The perspiration broke out on his forehead . Who was it , moving secretly and silently along the corridors ? Some one who was up to no good , he 'd bet that ! Noiselessly , in spite of his heavy build , he dropped off the bed and with two strides was standing by the door listening . But the sound did not come again . Nevertheless Blore was convinced that he was not mistaken . He had heard a footfall just outside his door . The hair rose slightly on his scalp . He knew fear again ... Some one creeping about stealthily in the night ... He listened but the sound was not repeated . And now a new temptation assailed him . He wanted , desperately , to go out and investigate . If he could only see who it was prowling about in the darkness . But to open his door would be the action of a fool . Very likely that was exactly what the other was waiting for . He might even have meant Blore to hear what he had heard , counting on him coming out to investigate . Blore stood rigid listening . He could hear sounds everywhere now , cracks , mstles , mysterious whispers but his dogged realistic brain knew them for what they were the creations of his own heated imagination . And then suddenly he heard something that was not imagination . Footsteps , very soft , very cautious , but plainly audible to a man listening with all his ears as Blore was listening . They came softly along the corridor ( both Lombard 's and Armstrong 's rooms were farther from the stairhead than his ) . They passed his door without hesitating or faltering . And as they did so , Blore made up his mind . He meant to see who it was ! The footsteps had definitely passed his door going to the stairs . Where was the man going ? When Blore acted , he acted quickly , surprisingly so for a man who looked so heavy and slow . He tiptoed back to the bed , slipped matches into his pocket , detached the plug of the electric lamp by his bed , and picked it up winding the flex round it . It was a chromium affair with a heavy ebonite base a useful weapon . He sprinted noiselessly across the room , removed the chair from under the door handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted the door . He stepped out into the corridor . There was a faint sound in the hall below ; Blore ran noiselessly in his stockinged feet to the head of the stairs . At that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so clearly . The wind had died down completely and the sky must have cleared . There was faint moonlight coming in through the landing window and it illuminated the hall below . Blore had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure just passing out through the front door . In the act of running down the stairs in pursuit , he paused . Once again , he had nearly made a fool of himself ! This was a trap , perhaps , to lure him out of the house ! But what the other man did n't realize was that he had made a mistake , had delivered himself neady into Blore 's hands . For , of the three tenanted rooms upstairs , one must now be empty . All that had to be done was to ascertain which ! Blore went swiftly back along the corridor . He paused first at Dr. Armstrong 's door and tapped . There was no answer . He waited a minute , then went on to Philip Lombard 's room . Here the answer came at once . "
51459	51460	51463	51463	Blore	88	" "
51478	51497	51498	51499	Miss Claythorne	121	" He went on to the door at the end of the corridor . Here he tapped again . "
51504	51514	51501	51502	Miss Claythorne	121	" Vera 's voice , startled , answered him : "
51524	51525	51531	51532	Miss Claythorne	121	" "
51543	51599	51538	51538	I	0	" He raced back to Lombard 's room . The door opened as he did so . Lombard stood there . He held a candle in his left hand . He had pulled on his trousers over his pyjamas . His right hand rested in the pocket of his pyjama jacket . He said sharply : "
51607	51618	51619	51619	Armstrong	80	" Blore explained rapidly . Lombard 's eyes lit up . "
51628	51637	51640	51640	Blore	88	" He moved along to Armstrong 's door . "
51650	51658	51659	51660	Armstrong Armstrong	1429	" He rapped sharply on the panel . "
51662	51692	51659	51660	Armstrong Armstrong	1429	" There was no answer . Lombard dropped to his knees and peered through the keyhole . He inserted his little finger gingerly into the lock . He said : "
51703	51707	51659	51660	Armstrong Armstrong	1429	" Blore said : "
51722	51726	51710	51710	he	80	" Philip nodded : "
51751	51760	51761	51761	Vera	121	" He raced along to Vera 's room . "
51763	51764	51761	51761	Vera	121	" "
51767	51768	51761	51761	Vera	121	" "
51793	51794	51782	51782	you	121	" "
51799	51800	51782	51782	you	121	" "
51840	51844	51782	51782	you	121	" Vera said : "
51854	51858	51847	51847	I	0	" Lombard said : "
51861	51869	51847	51847	I	0	" He joined Blore . He said : "
51880	51884	51885	51885	We	1432	" Blore said : "
51899	51911	51891	51891	He	80	" Philip Lombard raced down the stairs chuckling . He said : "
51919	51928	51891	51891	He	80	" He undid the front door , remarking : "
51941	51946	51891	51891	He	80	" He went on : "
51953	51966	51947	51947	I	0	" He took it half out of his pocket as he spoke . "
51976	51997	51947	51947	I	0	" Blore stopped dead on the doorstep . His face changed . Philip Lombard saw it . He said impatiently : "
52031	52055	52025	52025	I	0	" He started off into the moonlight . Blore , after a minute 's hesitation , followed him . He thought to himself : "
52066	52548	52549	52549	Vera	121	" After all he had tackled criminals armed with revolvers before now . Whatever else he lacked , Blore did not lack courage . Show him the danger and he would tackle it pluckily . He was not afraid of danger in the open , only of danger undefined and tinged with the supernatural . Vera , left to wait results , got up and dressed . She glanced over once or twice at the door . It was a good solid door . It was both bolted and locked and had an oak chair wedged under the handle . It could not be broken open by force . Certainly not by Dr. Armstrong . He was not a physically powerful man . If she were Armstrong intent on murder , it was cunning that she would employ , not force . She amused herself by reflecting on the means he might employ . He might , as Philip had suggested , announce that one of the other two men was dead . Or he might possibly pretend to be mortally wounded himself , might drag himself groaning to her door . There were other possibilities . He might inform her that the house was on fire . More , he might actually set the house on fire ... Yes , that would be a possibility . Lure the other two men out of the house , then , having previously laid a trail of petrol , he might set light to it . And she , like an idiot , would remain barricaded in her room until it was too late . She crossed over to the window . Not too bad . At a pinch one could escape that way . It would mean a drop but there was a handy flowerbed . She sat down and picking up her diary began to write in it in a clear flowing hand . One must pass the time . Suddenly she stiffened to attention . She had heard a sound . It was , she thought , a sound like breaking glass . And it came from somewhere downstairs . She listened hard , but the sound was not repeated . She heard , or thought she heard , stealthy sounds of footsteps , the creak of stairs , the rustle of garments but there was nothing definite , and she concluded , as Blore had done earlier , that such sounds had their origin in her own imagination . But presently she heard sounds of a more concrete nature . People moving about downstairs the murmur of voices . Then the very decided sound of some one mounting the stairs doors opening and shutting feet going up to the attics overhead . More noises from there . Finally the steps came along the passage . Lombard 's voice said : "
52555	52556	52551	52551	You	121	" "
52563	52569	52571	52571	you	121	" Blore 's voice said : "
52576	52625	52571	52571	you	121	" Vera went to the door . She removed the chair , unlocked the door and slid back the bolt . She opened the door . The two men were breathing hard , their feet and the bottom of their trousers were soaking wet . She said again : "
52630	52634	52635	52635	Armstrong	80	" Lombard said : "
52639	52643	52635	52635	Armstrong	80	" Vera cried : "
52646	52650	52635	52635	Armstrong	80	" Lombard said : "
52657	52661	52635	52635	Armstrong	80	" Blore concurred : "
52674	52679	52635	52635	Armstrong	80	" Vera said impatiently : "
52687	52691	52694	52694	he	80	" Blore said : "
52738	52742	52743	52743	He	80	" Vera said : "
52750	52754	52743	52743	He	80	" Blore said : "
52789	52794	52767	52767	You	121	" Vera said incredulously : "
52800	52804	52767	52767	You	121	" Lombard said : "
52812	52819	52767	52767	You	121	" He paused and then said : "
52848	52950	52839	52846	only three little Indian boys on the table	1442	" Three people sat eating breakfast in the kitchen . Outside , the sun shone . It was a lovely day . The storm was a thing of the past . And with the change in the weather , a change had come in the mood of the prisoners on the island . They felt now like people just awakening from a nightmare . There was danger , yet , but it was danger in daylight . That paralyzing atmosphere of fear that had wrapped them round like a blanket yesterday while the wind howled outside was gone . Lombard said : "
53012	53016	53000	53000	they	1446	" Vera said : "
53039	53043	53026	53026	they	1446	" Lombard said : "
53079	53083	53064	53064	They	1446	" Vera cried : "
53090	53096	53064	53064	They	1446	" Lombard shrugged his shoulders . "
53124	53133	53134	53134	We	1438	" Blore cleared his throat . He said : "
53149	53153	53147	53147	Armstrong	80	" Lombard said : "
53184	53188	53178	53178	Armstrong	80	" Vera said : "
53199	53203	53193	53193	you	1455	" Blore said : "
53206	53215	53193	53193	you	1455	" Lombard shook his head . He said : "
53225	53230	53231	53231	It	1456	" Blore said doubtfully : "
53240	53245	53231	53231	It	1456	" Lombard said sharply : "
53296	53300	53263	53263	You	1455	" Blore said : "
53311	53315	53330	53330	your	1455	" Lombard said : "
53320	53324	53330	53330	your	1455	" Blore said : "

53419	53423	53424	53424	You	1455	" Blore said : "
53452	53459	53435	53436	the devil	1460	" Lombard raised his shoulders hopelessly . "
53485	53489	53435	53436	the devil	1460	" Blore agreed . "
53505	53506	53496	53496	You	1455	" "
53520	53521	53496	53496	You	1455	" "
53530	53534	53535	53535	You	1455	" Philip said : "
53539	53543	53535	53535	You	1455	" Blore said : "
53560	53564	53558	53558	you	92	" Philip murmured : "
53583	53589	53571	53573	an honest man	1466	" Blore went on stolidly : "
53648	53663	53667	53668	an ass	1468	" Philip Lombard lit a cigarette . As he puffed smoke , he said : "
53670	53671	53667	53668	an ass	1468	" "
53679	53680	53672	53672	You	92	" "
53704	53708	53697	53697	I	0	" Blore said : "

53766	53775	53737	53737	I	0	" Blore shook his head . He said : "
53792	53808	53785	53785	You	92	" Vera had taken no part in the discussion . She stirred now and said : "
53820	53826	53815	53818	a pair of idiots	1470	" Lombard looked at her . "
53831	53835	53815	53818	a pair of idiots	1470	" Vera said : "
53853	53861	53862	53865	Four little Indian boys	493	" She recited in a meaning voice : "
53882	53887	53871	53873	A red herring	1473	" She went on : "
53939	53948	53949	53949	You	92	" Lombard sat down again . He said : "
53957	53961	53949	53949	You	92	" Blore said : "
53982	53987	53972	53972	We	1478	" Vera said scornfully : "
54013	54017	54047	54047	I	0	" Lombard murmured : "
54036	54040	54047	54047	I	0	" Vera said : "

54162	54166	54147	54152	some horrible child playing a game	1483	" Blore said : "
54173	54179	54147	54152	some horrible child playing a game	1483	" He thought a minute . "
54202	54206	54209	54209	you	80	" Vera cried : "
54232	54337	54209	54209	you	80	" They spent the morning on the cliffs , taking it in turns to flash a mirror at the mainland . There were no signs that any one saw them . No answering signals . The day was fine , with a slight haze . Below , the sea weaved in a gigantic swell . There were no boats out . They had made another abortive search of the island . There was no trace of the missing physician . Vera looked up at the house from where they were standing . She said , her breath coming with a slight catch in it : "
54359	54363	54351	54351	's	1486	" Lombard said : "

54423	54427	54412	54412	We	1486	" Vera shuddered , "
54440	54444	54445	54445	You	1496	" Philip said : "
54455	54459	54445	54445	You	1496	" Vera murmured : "
54463	54472	54445	54445	You	1496	" She stretched out her hands , murmuring : "
54482	54486	54445	54445	You	1496	" She thought : "
54525	54536	54578	54579	Miss Claythorne	121	" Blore was looking at his wristwatch . He said : "
54546	54551	54552	54552	I	0	" Vera said obstinately : "
54571	54572	54561	54561	I	0	" "
54591	54595	54584	54584	your	121	" Vera said : "
54628	54632	54613	54613	People	1853	" Blore said : "
54647	54651	54644	54645	Mr. Lombard	92	" Philip said : "
54673	54680	54690	54690	he	0	" Blore hesitated . Vera said : "
54710	54714	54690	54690	he	0	" Blore said : "
54733	54737	54738	54738	You	121	" Philip said : "
54761	54762	54752	54752	I	0	" "
54769	54773	54765	54765	you	0	" said Blore . "
54779	54783	54774	54774	You	0	" Philip laughed . "
54804	54808	54765	54765	you	0	" Blore said : "
54839	54840	54907	54907	you	121	" "
54843	54847	54848	54848	you	121	" said Philip , "
54856	54857	54848	54848	you	121	" "
54861	54865	54848	54848	you	121	" said Blore , "
54877	54882	54961	54961	he	1507	" Philip said softly : "
54909	54932	54907	54907	you	121	" Blore shrugged his shoulders and began to make his way up the steep slope to the house . Lombard said softly : "
54948	54953	54961	54961	he	1507	" Vera said anxiously : "
54965	54966	54961	54961	he	1507	" "
55029	55030	55024	55024	he	80	" "
55038	55043	55046	55046	Blore	88	" Philip said softly : "
55048	55049	55046	55046	Blore	88	" "
55056	55057	55052	55052	you	0	" "
55151	55152	55143	55143	Armstrong	80	" "
55155	55161	55143	55143	Armstrong	80	" Lombard shrugged his shoulders . "
55239	55254	55229	55229	He	553	" Vera had gone rather white . She said in a slightly breathless voice : "
55261	55273	55229	55229	He	553	" Lombard said softly , patting the revolver in his pocket : "
55286	55294	55282	55282	he	553	" Then he looked at her curiously . "
55313	55317	55318	55318	One	288	" Vera said : "
55344	55351	55342	55342	Armstrong	80	" She turned to him suddenly . "
55371	55376	55365	55366	Some one	606	" Lombard said slowly : "
55382	55387	55365	55366	Some one	606	" Vera said eagerly : "
55394	55404	55389	55389	you	0	" She shivered . She bent a little closer . "
55411	55419	55407	55407	you	0	" She broke off , went on : "
55456	55465	55466	55467	Heavenly visitants	1528	" Lombard raised his eyebrows . He said : "
55486	55494	55496	55496	I	0	" Vera said in a low voice : "
55501	55510	55496	55496	I	0	" Lombard looked at her . He said : "
55515	55526	55528	55528	you	0	" After a moment 's silence he said very quietly : "
55536	55541	55528	55528	you	0	" Vera said vehemently : "
55556	55561	55548	55548	You	0	" He laughed easily . "
55594	55618	55622	55625	a man in it	1532	" A sudden feeling of lassitude , of intense weariness , spread over Vera 's limbs . She said in a dull voice : "
55627	55632	55622	55625	a man in it	1532	" Lombard said softly : "
55642	55651	55671	55671	Queer	139	" Vera sat up suddenly . She exclaimed : "
55662	55666	55622	55625	a man in it	1532	" Lombard said : "
55692	55703	55671	55671	Queer	139	" They stared up at the house . Lombard said : "
55717	55718	55709	55709	We	1533	" "
55728	55729	55709	55709	We	1533	" "
55735	55740	55731	55731	yourself	0	" Vera said desperately : "
55750	55830	55744	55744	I	0	" They walked up the slope to the house . The terrace was peaceful and innocuouslooking in the sunshine . They hesitated there a minute , then instead of entering by the front door , they made a cautious circuit of the house . They found Blore . He was spreadeagled on the stone terrace on the east side , his head crushed and mangled by a great block of white marble . Philip looked up . He said : "
55838	55847	55744	55744	I	0	" Vera said in a low shuddering voice : "
55870	55880	55744	55744	I	0	" She repeated and her voice shook and quavered : "
55888	55905	55744	55744	I	0	" Philip grasped her shoulder . He said , and his voice was urgent and grim : "
55926	55936	55919	55919	I	0	" But Vera clung to him . She cried : "
55966	55974	55960	55960	He	80	" Philip stopped . He said thoughtfully : "
55981	55985	55960	55960	He	80	" Vera cried : "
55997	56001	55990	55990	you	0	" He nodded . "
56031	56036	56021	56021	We	1537	" Vera said urgently : "
56057	56062	56046	56046	you	0	" Lombard said reluctantly : "
56066	56067	56046	56046	you	0	" "
56100	56101	56091	56092	a Priest	1542	" "
56112	56113	56114	56114	He	80	" "
56121	56131	56114	56114	He	80	" Philip Lombard shook his head . He said : "
56150	56154	56140	56140	I	0	" Vera said : "
56159	56163	56164	56164	I	0	" Lombard said : "
56169	56173	56164	56164	I	0	" Vera cried : "
56195	56208	56187	56187	He	80	" Lombard said , half bringing out the revolver from his pocket : "
56217	56218	56219	56219	You	0	" "
56285	56298	56273	56273	He	661	" Lombard put back the revolver in his pocket . He said : "
56304	56310	56273	56273	He	661	" Lombard said at last : "
56321	56332	56333	56333	You	0	" Vera did n't answer . He went on accusingly : "
56340	56345	56333	56333	You	0	" She said helplessly : "
56360	56366	56356	56356	I	0	" Philip Lombard said thoughtfully : "
56425	56429	56430	56430	You	0	" He paused : "
56442	56450	56430	56430	You	0	" Vera said with a raucous laugh : "
56460	56466	56581	56581	You	0	" Philip Lombard said quietly : "
56473	56481	56581	56581	You	0	" Vera moved restlessly . She said : "
56496	56497	56581	56581	You	0	" "
56501	56552	56581	56581	You	0	" They paced slowly up and down , along the line of the rocks overlooking the sea . The sun was dropping towards the west . The light was golden and mellow . It enveloped them in a golden glow . Vera said , with a sudden nervous little giggle : "
56561	56574	56581	56581	You	0	" Philip was looking down towards the sea . He said abruptly : "
56596	56603	56581	56581	You	0	" Vera stared . She said : "
56611	56612	56607	56607	somebody	979	" "
56618	56622	56698	56699	a man	1881	" Lombard laughed . "
56631	56635	56581	56581	You	0	" Vera said : "
56642	56643	56581	56581	You	0	" "
56648	56657	56581	56581	You	0	" said . Lombard as they drew nearer . "
56677	56691	56698	56699	a man	1881	" They scrambled over the rocks . Vera stopped suddenly . She said : "
56701	56746	56698	56699	a man	1881	" The man was wedged between two rocks , flung there by the tide earlier in the day . Lombard and Vera reached it in a last scramble . They bent down . A purple discoloured face a hideous drowned face ... Lombard said : "
56754	56825	56752	56752	Armstrong	80	" Aeons passed ... worlds span and whirled ... Time was motionless ... It stood still it passed through a thousand ages ... No , it was only a minute or so ... Two people were standing looking down on a dead man ... Slowly , very slowly , Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard lifted their heads and looked into each other 's eyes ... Lombard laughed . He said : "
56836	56840	56834	56834	Vera	121	" Vera said : "
56856	56868	56834	56834	Vera	121	" Her voice was a whisper nothing more . Lombard said : "
56882	56886	56880	56880	we	1560	" Vera said : "
56898	56904	56880	56880	we	1560	" He shrugged his shoulders . "
56916	56925	56880	56880	we	1560	" Their eyes met again . Vera thought : "
56951	56964	56880	56880	we	1560	" Lombard said , and his voice was a snarl dangerous menacing : "
56987	56992	56970	56970	you	1563	" Vera said quietly : "
56995	57025	56970	56970	you	1563	" She stared out to sea . General Macarthur had stared out to sea when only yesterday ? Or was it the day before ? He too had said , "
57031	57072	57074	57075	Dr. Armstrong	80	" He had said it with acceptance almost with welcome . But to Vera the words the thought brought rebellion . No , it should not be the end . She looked down at the dead man . She said : "
57077	57084	57074	57075	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Lombard sneered . He said : "
57092	57096	57074	57075	Dr. Armstrong	80	" Vera said : "
57106	57110	57102	57102	you	1562	" He said : "
57123	57135	57136	57136	We	1564	" Vera looked down again at the body . She said : "
57148	57149	57136	57136	We	1564	" "
57176	57180	57169	57169	he	1565	" Vera said : "
57196	57203	57205	57205	you	1563	" Lombard laughed . He said : "
57208	57236	57205	57205	you	1563	" He bent tugging at the body . Vera leaned against him , helping him . She pulled and tugged with all her might . Lombard panted : "
57243	57267	57205	57205	you	1563	" They managed it , however , drawing the body clear of the high water mark . Lombard said as he straightened up : "
57270	57274	57205	57205	you	1563	" Vera said : "
57277	57324	57205	57205	you	1563	" Her tone warned him . He spun around . Even as he clapped his hand to his pocket he knew that he would find it empty . She had moved a yard or two and was facing him , revolver in hand . Lombard said : "
57342	57383	57335	57335	You	1569	" She nodded . She held it steadily and unwaveringly . Death was very near to Philip Lombard now . It had never , he knew , been nearer . Nevertheless he was not beaten yet . He said authoritatively : "
57390	57397	57335	57335	You	1569	" Vera laughed . Lombard said : "
57405	57448	57335	57335	You	1569	" His quick brain was working . Which way which method talk her over lull her into security or a swift dash All his life Lombard had taken the risky way . He took it now . He spoke slowly , argumentatively . "
57460	57819	57457	57457	you	2577	" And then he sprang . Quick as a panther as any other feline creature ... Automatically Vera pressed the trigger ... Lombard 's leaping body stayed poised in midspring , then crashed heavily to the ground . Vera came warily forward , the revolver ready in her hand . But there was no need of caution . Philip Lombard was dead shot through the heart ... Relief possessed Vera enormous exquisite relief . At last it was over . There was no more fear no more steeling of her nerves ... She was alone on the island ... Alone with nine dead bodies ... But what did that matter ? She was alive ... She sat there exquisitely happy exquisitely at peace ... No more fear ... The sun was setting when Vera moved at last . Sheer reaction had kept her immobile . There had been no room in her for anything but the glorious sense of safety . She realized now that she was hungry and sleepy . Principally sleepy . She wanted to throw herself on her bed and sleep and sleep and sleep ... Tomorrow , perhaps , they would come and rescue her but she did n't really mind . She did n't mind staying here . Not now that she was alone ... Oh ! blessed , blessed peace ... She got to her feet and glanced up at the house . Nothing to be afraid of any longer ! No terrors waiting for her ! Just an ordinary wellbuilt modern house . And yet , a little earlier in the day , she had not been able to look at it without shivering ... Fear what a strange thing fear was ... Well , it was over now . She had conquered had triumphed over the most deadly peril . By her own quickwittedness and adroitness she had turned the tables on her wouldbe destroyer . She began to walk up towards the house . The sun was setting , the sky to the west was streaked with red and orange . It was beautiful and peaceful ... Vera thought : "
57828	57905	57457	57457	you	2577	" How tired she was terribly tired . Her limbs ached , her eyelids were drooping . Not to be afraid any more ... To sleep . Sleep ... sleep ... sleep ... To sleep safely since she was alone on the island . One little Indian boy left all alone . She smiled to herself . She went in at the front door . The house , too , felt strangely peaceful . Vera thought : "
57924	57980	57981	57981	You	1572	" Should she go the kitchen and get herself something to eat ? She hesitated a moment , then decided against it . She was really too tired ... She paused by the diningroom door . There were still three little china figures in the middle of the table . Vera laughed . She said : "
57990	58032	57981	57981	You	1572	" She picked up two of them and tossed them out through the window . She heard them crash on the stone of the terrace . The third little figure she picked up and held in her hand . She said : "
58050	58086	58087	58090	One little Indian boy	500	" The hall was dim in the dying light . Vera , the little Indian clasped in her hand , began to mount the stairs . Slowly , because her legs were suddenly very tired . "
58095	58105	58087	58090	One little Indian boy	500	" How did it end ? Oh , yes ! "
58115	58151	58087	58090	One little Indian boy	500	" Married ... Funny , how she suddenly got the feeling again that Hugo was in the house ... Very strong . Yes , Hugo was upstairs waiting for her . Vera said to herself : "
58171	58246	58247	58250	One little Indian boy	500	" Slowly up the stairs ... At the top of them something fell from her hand , making hardly any noise on the soft pile carpet . She did not notice that she had dropped the revolver . She was only conscious of clasping a little china figure . How very quiet the house was . And yet it did n't seem like an empty house ... Hugo , upstairs , waiting for her ... "
58357	58417	58418	58418	You	1580	" He went and hanged himself and then there were none ... The little china figure fell from her hand . It rolled unheeded and broke against the fender . Like an automaton Vera moved forward . This was the end here where the cold wet hand ( Cyril 's hand , of course ) had touched her throat ... "
58427	58504	58425	58425	Cyril	67	" That was what murder was as easy as that ! But afterwards you went on remembering ... She climbed up on the chair , her eyes staring in front of her like a sleepwalker 's ... She adjusted the noose round her neck . Hugo was there to see she did what she had to do . She kicked away the chair ... Sir Thomas Legge , Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard , said irritably : "
58512	58518	58521	58521	sir	1898	" Inspector Maine said respectfully : "
58523	58529	58521	58521	sir	1898	" The A.C. went on : "
58550	58556	58577	58577	somebody	979	" Inspector Maine said stolidly : "
58564	58570	58562	58562	sir	1898	" Sir Thomas Legge said : "
58583	58584	58577	58577	somebody	979	" "
58593	58594	58591	58591	sir	1898	" "
58603	58604	58591	58591	sir	1898	" "
58684	58692	58679	58680	Vera Claythorne	121	" The A.C. winced . He said : "
58699	58712	58679	58680	Vera Claythorne	121	" He considered for a minute or two . He said irritably : "
58742	58749	58750	58750	They	1594	" Inspector Maine shrugged his shoulders . "
58778	58779	58768	58768	Owen	122	" "
58791	58792	58795	58795	Morris	72	" "
58800	58801	58797	58798	Isaac Morris	72	" "
58811	58812	58813	58813	He	72	" "
58825	58830	58813	58813	He	72	" The A.C. frowned . "
58839	58840	58836	58837	this Morris	72	" "
58915	58916	58908	58911	a very careful man	1603	" "
58925	58926	58918	58918	he	72	" "
58954	58955	58937	58937	he	72	" "
58971	58976	58979	58979	you	1898	" Inspector Maine smiled . "
59031	59042	59022	59022	he	72	" The other man sighed . Inspector Maine went on : "
59112	59122	59124	59124	you	1611	" Sir Thomas Legge stirred uneasily . He said : "
59141	59150	59124	59124	you	1611	" Maine shrugged his shoulders . He said : "
59234	59249	59250	59251	Fred Narracott	95	" The Assistant Commissioner admitted gloomily that he supposed it was . Maine said : "
59333	59334	59325	59325	he	96	" "
59344	59345	59325	59325	he	96	" "
59423	59424	59396	59396	They	569	" "
59433	59434	59427	59428	some one	606	" "
59476	59484	59459	59459	people	1853	" The A.C. sighed . He said : "
59508	59513	59514	59514	I	0	" Inspector Maine said : "
59578	59582	59726	59726	He	53	" Legge said : "
59592	59598	59726	59726	He	53	" Inspector Maine said gravely : "
59607	59613	59726	59726	He	53	" He cleared his throat . "
59624	59715	59726	59726	He	53	" Starting with the Rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island . They were in service with a Miss Brady who died suddenly . Ca n't get anything definite out of the doctor who attended her . He says they certainly did n't poison her , or anything like that , but his personal belief if that there was some funny business that she died as the result of neglect on their part . Says it 's the sort of thing that 's quite impossible to prove . "
59734	59793	59726	59726	He	53	" By the way , Seton was guilty unmistakably guilty . Evidence turned up later after he was hanged which proved that beyond any shadow of doubt . But there was a good deal of comment at the time nine people out of ten thought Seton was innocent and that the judge 's summing up had been vindictive . "
59857	59858	59881	59882	Wellknown man	1648	" "
59862	59876	59877	59878	Dr. Armstrong	80	" said the A.C. with a sigh . Maine took a deep breath . "
59992	60035	60041	60042	the A.C.	2888	" Then there 's Miss Emily Brent . Girl , Beatrice Taylor , was in service with her . Got pregnant , was turned out by her mistress and went and drowned herself . Not a nice business but again not criminal . "
60036	60039	60041	60042	the A.C.	2888	" That , "
60044	60063	60064	60064	Maine	170	" seems to be the point . U.N. Owen dealt with cases that the law could n't touch . "
60072	60145	60064	60064	Maine	170	" Young Marston was a fairly reckless car driver had his license endorsed twice and he ought to have been prohibited from driving , in my opinion . That 's all there is to him . The two names John and Lucy Combes were those of two kids he knocked down and killed near Cambridge . Some friends of his gave evidence for him and he was let off with a fine . "
60223	60224	60209	60210	commanding officers	1656	" "
60227	60231	60209	60210	commanding officers	1656	" said the A.C. "
60286	60293	60294	60294	Maine	170	" Then we come to Blore . "
60297	60307	60294	60294	Maine	170	" He of course was one of our lot . "
60313	60316	60318	60320	the Assistant Commissioner	2891	" Blore , "
60323	60329	60318	60320	the Assistant Commissioner	2891	" was a bad hat ! "
60330	60337	60338	60339	The A.C.	171	" You think so , sir ? "
60342	60426	60338	60339	The A.C.	171	" always thought so . But he was clever enough to get away with it . It 's my opinion that he committed black perjury in the Landor case . was n't happy about it at the time . But could n't find anything . put Hams onto it and he could n't find anything but I 'm still of the opinion that there was something to find if we 'd known how to set about it . The man was n't straight . "
60438	60453	60433	60435	Sir Thomas Legge	169	" And Isaac Morris is dead , you say ? When did he die ? "
60454	60501	60502	60502	Legge	169	" thought you 'd soon come to that , sir . Isaac Morris died on the night of August 8th . Took an overdose of sleeping stuff one of the barbiturates , understand . There was n't anything to show whether it was accident or suicide . "
60506	60515	60502	60502	Legge	169	" Care to know what think , Maine ? "
60516	60523	60524	60524	Legge	169	" Perhaps can guess , sir . "
60528	60541	60524	60524	Legge	169	" That death of Morris ' is a damned sight too opportune ! "
60549	60558	60546	60546	He	170	" thought you 'd say that , sir . "
60577	60610	60573	60573	He	2891	" The whole thing 's fantastic impossible . Ten people killed on a bare rock of an island and we do n't know who did it , or why , or how . "
60617	60678	60614	60614	He	170	" Well , it 's not quite like that , sir . We do know why , more or less . Some fanatic with a bee in his bonnet about justice . He was out to get people who were beyond the reach of the law . He picked ten people whether they were really guilty or not does n't matter "
60687	60696	60697	60697	He	170	" Does n't it ? It seems to me "
60713	60717	60718	60718	he	169	" Carry on , "
60721	60757	60758	60758	Maine	170	" Just for a minute felt I 'd got somewhere . Got , as it were , the clue to the thing . It 's gone now . Go ahead with what you were saying . "
60762	60799	60758	60758	Maine	170	" There were ten people to be executed , let 's say . They were executed . U.N. Owen accomplished his task . And somehow or other he spirited himself off that island into thin air . "
60804	60821	60822	60822	Maine	170	" Firstclass vanishing trick . But you know , Maine , there must be an explanation . "
60825	60882	60822	60822	Maine	170	" You 're thinking , sir , that if the man was n't on the island , he couldn'l have left the island , and according to the account of the interested parties he never was on the island . Well , then the only explanation possible is that he was actually one of the ten . "
60891	61026	60887	60887	Maine	170	" We thought of that , sir . We went into it . Now , to begin with , we 're not quite in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island . Vera Claythorne kept a diary , so did Emily Brent . Old Wargrave made some notes dry legal cryptic stuff , but quite clear . And Blore made notes too . All those accounts tally . The deaths occurred in this order : Marston , Mrs. Rogers , Macarthur , Rogers , Miss Brent , Wargrave . After his death Vera Claythorne 's diary states that Armstrong left the house in the night and that Blore and Lombard had gone after him . Blore has one more entry in his notebook . Just two words : ' Armstrong disappeared . ' "
61096	61297	61298	61298	You	1670	" That was a good solution but it wo n't do . No , sir , it wo n't do . First of all there 's the police surgeon 's evidence . He got to the island early on the morning of August 13th . He could n't say much to help us . All he could say was that all the people had been dead at least thirtysix hours and probably a good deal longer . But he was fairly definite about Armstrong . Said he must have been from eight to ten hours in the water before his body was washed up . That works out at this , that Armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night of the 10th 11th and I 'll explain why . We found the point where the body was washed up it had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth , hair , etc . on them . It must have been deposited there at high water on the 11th that 's to say round about 11 o'clock A.M. After that , the storm subsided , and succeeding high water marks are considerably lower . "
61370	61390	61391	61391	He	80	" So that settles one point definitely . Some one was alive on the island after Armstrong was dead . "
61398	61497	61391	61391	He	80	" And that leaves just what exactly ? Here 's the position early on the morning of the 11th . Armstrong has ' disappeared ' ( drowned ) . That leaves us three people . Lombard , Blore and Vera Claythorne . Lombard was shot . His body was down by the sea near Armstrong 's . Vera Claythorne was found hanged in her own bedroom . Blore 's body was on the terrace . His head was crushed in by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window above . "
61503	61507	61391	61391	He	80	" Whose window ? "
61508	61564	61391	61391	He	80	" Vera Claythorne 's . Now , sir , let 's take each of these cases separately . First Philip Lombard . Let 's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto Blore then he doped Vera Claythorne and strung her up . Lastly , he went down to the seashore and shot himself . "
61600	61605	61617	61618	Vera Claythorne	121	" The A.C. said : "
61611	61612	61615	61615	sir	1898	" "
61621	61622	61617	61618	Vera Claythorne	121	" "
61629	61630	61617	61618	Vera Claythorne	121	" "
61671	61728	61669	61669	herself	121	" And that 's quite all right up to a point . There 's a chair in her bedroom and on the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on her shoes . Looks as though she stood on the chair , adjusted the rope round her neck and kicked away the chair . "
61768	61863	61864	61866	The Assistant Commissioner	2891	" That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard and inducing Vera Claythorne to hang herself he then went out and pulled down a whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it or something like that well , simply do n't believe you . Men do n't commit suicide that way and what 's more Blore was n't that kind of man . We knew Blore and he was not the man that you 'd ever accuse of a desire for abstract justice . "
61869	61872	61864	61866	The Assistant Commissioner	2891	" agree . "
61877	61945	61873	61874	Inspector Maine	170	" And therefore , sir , there must have been some one else on the island . Some one who tidied up when the whole business was over . But where was he all the time and where did he go to ? The Sticklehaven people are absolutely certain that no one could have left the island before the rescue boat got there . But in that case "
61954	61958	61949	61951	The Assistant Commissioner	2891	" In that case "
61971	61977	61978	61978	he	2891	" But in that case , "
61981	61986	61978	61978	he	2891	" who killed them ? "
63349	63378	63346	63346	He	1740	" You 're right . Murder is n't what most people think giving some one a dollop of arsenic pushing them over a cliff that sort of stuff . "
63392	63502	63389	63389	He	1740	" I 've known a murderess known her , tell you . And what 's more was crazy about her ... God help me , sometimes think still am ... It 's Hell , tell you Hell You see , she did it more or less for me ... Not that ever dreamed . Women are fiends absolute fiends you would n't think a girl like that a nice straight jolly girl you would n't think she 'd do that , would you ? That she 'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown you would n't think a woman could do a thing like that ? "
63507	63516	63517	63517	He	1741	" Are you sure she did do it ? "
63530	63571	63523	63523	he	1741	" I 'm quite sure . Nobody else ever thought of it . But knew the moment looked at her when got back after ... And she knew knew ... What she did n't realize was that loved that kid ... "
64915	64922	64904	64904	he	80	" A red herring swallowed one ... "
65712	65715	65689	65690	the murderer	2503	" red herring "
