3463	3483	3460	3461	Mr. Blore	93	" No , I forgot . There 's that old military gent . He 'd spot me at once . "

3528	3638	3639	3639	You	0	" Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials . As a man of means from South Africa , Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society unchallenged . Indian Island . He remembered Indian Island as a boy ... Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls stood about a mile from the coast . It had got its name from its resemblance to a man 's head an American Indian profile . Funny idea to go and build a house on it ! Awful in bad weather ! But millionaires were full of whims ! The old man in the corner woke up and said : "

3724	3743	3720	3720	you	0	" said Mr. Blore pacifically . The train stopped at a station and the old fellow rose unsteadily . "

3803	3829	3830	3830	I	0	" He collapsed through the doorway onto the platform . From a recumbent position he looked up at Mr. Blore and said with immense dignity : "

3872	3911	3912	3912	Jim	92	" But there , as it happens , he was wrong ... Chapter 2 . Outside Oakbridge station a little group of people stood in momentary uncertainty . Behind them stood porters with suitcases . One of these called "

3976	4028	3957	3958	The driver	326	" There are two taxis here , sir . One of them must wait till the slow train from Exeter gets in a matter of five minutes there 's one gentleman coming by that . Perhaps one of you would n't mind waiting ? You 'd be more comfortable that way . "

4190	4197	4181	4183	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Beautiful weather we are having . "
4202	4207	4198	4199	Miss Brent	76	" Yes , indeed . "
4245	4256	4240	4242	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4257	4279	4280	4281	The judge	338	" I have been to Cornwall and to Torquay , but this is my first visit to this part of Devon . "
4284	4296	4280	4281	The judge	338	" I also am unacquainted with this part of the world . "
4310	4320	4302	4307	The driver of the second taxi	340	" Like to sit inside while you 're waiting ? "
4325	4330	4321	4321	Vera	125	" Not at all . "
4338	4355	4335	4335	He	72	" That sunny wall looks more attractive . Unless you 'd rather go inside the station ? "
4356	4373	4374	4374	He	72	" No , indeed . It 's so delightful to get out of that stuffy train . "
4377	4390	4391	4391	Vera	125	" Yes , travelling by train is rather trying in this weather . "
4395	4414	4391	4391	Vera	125	" I do hope it lasts the weather , I mean . Our English summers are so treacherous . "
4424	4435	4421	4421	Lombard	71	" Do you know this part of the world well ? "
4436	4446	4447	4447	She	125	" No , I 've never been here before . "
4461	4471	4447	4447	She	125	" I have n't even seen my employer yet . "
4472	4476	4510	4510	He	71	" Your employer ? "
4477	4487	4447	4447	She	125	" Yes , I 'm Mrs. Owen 's secretary . "
4488	4494	4497	4497	his	71	" Oh , I see . "
4513	4520	4510	4510	He	71	" Is n't that rather unusual ? "
4524	4556	4521	4521	Vera	125	" Oh , no , I do n't think so . Her own secretary was suddenly taken ill and she wired to an agency for a substitute and they sent me . "
4557	4577	4578	4578	Vera	125	" So that was it . And suppose you do n't like the post when you 've got there ? "
4582	4640	4641	4641	Lombard	71	" Oh , it 's only temporary a holiday post . I 've got a permanent job at a girls ' school . As a matter of fact I 'm frightfully thrilled at the prospect of seeing Indian Island . There 's been such a lot about it in the papers . Is it really very fascinating ? "
4644	4656	4641	4641	Lombard	71	" I do n't know . I have n't seen it . "
4657	4682	4683	4683	Lombard	71	" Oh , really ? The Owens are frightfully keen on it , I suppose . What are they like ? Do tell me . "
4686	4700	4683	4683	Lombard	71	" Awkward , this am I supposed to have met them or not ? "
4705	4720	4701	4701	He	71	" There 's a wasp crawling up your arm . No keep quite still . "
4727	4734	4721	4721	He	71	" There . It 's gone ! "
4735	4751	4808	4820	a tall soldierly old man who appeared at the exit from the platform	344	" Oh , thank you . There are a lot of wasps about this summer . "
4752	4772	4721	4721	He	71	" Yes , I suppose it 's the heat . Who are we waiting for , do you know ? "
4773	4781	4721	4721	He	71	" I have n't the least idea . "
4797	4805	4794	4794	Lombard	71	" That will be the train now . "
4867	4882	4864	4864	She	125	" I am Mrs. Owen 's secretary . There is a car here waiting . "
4886	4892	4883	4883	She	125	" This is Mr. Lombard . "
4926	4938	4939	4942	The three of them	349	" Goodlooking fellow . Something just a little wrong about him ... "
4990	5015	4986	4987	General Macarthur	80	" Do n't know this part of Devon at all . My little place is in East Devon just on the borderline of Dorset . "
5019	5040	5016	5016	Vera	125	" It really is lovely here . The hills and the red earth and everything so green and luscious looking . "
5046	5068	5041	5042	Philip Lombard	71	" It 's a bit shut in ... I like open country myself . Where you can see what 's coming ... "
5075	5088	5069	5070	General Macarthur	80	" You 've seen a bit of the world , I fancy ? "
5095	5106	5091	5091	his	71	" I 've knocked about here and there , sir . "
5112	5135	5107	5107	He	71	" He 'll ask me now if I was old enough to be in the War . These old boys always do . "
5205	5213	5200	5200	Vera	125	" It 's a long way out . "
5311	5321	5322	5322	he	368	" Thought we might as well wait for you , "
5325	5355	5356	5356	He	368	" Make one trip of it . Allow me to introduce myself . Name 's Davis . Natal , South Africa 's my natal spot , ha , ha ! "
5397	5409	5411	5412	Mr. Davis	98	" Any one care for a little nip before we embark ? "
5430	5447	5448	5448	he	98	" Must n't delay , then . Our good host and hostess will be expecting us , "
5548	5596	5540	5540	He	1874	" Will you be ready to be starting for the island , ladies and gentlemen ? The boat 's waiting . There 's two gentlemen coming by car , but Mr. Owen 's orders was not to wait for them as they might arrive at any time . "
5624	5632	5620	5621	Emily Brent	76	" That 's a very small boat . "
5640	5663	5620	5621	Emily Brent	76	" She 's a fine boat , that , Ma'am . You could go to Plymouth in her as easy as winking . "
5670	5679	5664	5666	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" There are a good many of us . "
5680	5690	5691	5692	Philip Lombard	71	" She 'd take double the number , sir . "
5700	5712	5695	5695	his	71	" It 's quite all right . Glorious weather no swell . "
6432	6443	6427	6428	Philip Lombard	71	" Must be difficult to land here in dirty weather . "
6449	6473	6444	6445	Fred Narracott	100	" Ca n't land on Indian Island when there 's a southeasterly . Sometimes ' tis cut off for a week or more . "
6478	6502	6474	6475	Vera Claythorne	125	" The catering must be very difficult . That 's the worst of an island . All the domestic problems are so worrying . "
6552	6558	6548	6549	General Macarthur	80	" Ha , delightful spot ! "
6650	6659	6647	6647	He	459	" Will you come this way , please ? "
6736	6770	6730	6732	the butler chap	462	" Mr. Owen unfortunately delayed unable to get here till tomorrow . Instructions everything they wanted if they would like to go to their rooms ? ... dinner would be at 8 o'clock ... "
6827	6839	6822	6823	Mrs. Rogers	94	" I hope you 've got everything you want , Miss ? "
6876	6884	6872	6872	She	125	" Yes , everything , I think . "
6885	6898	6899	6900	Mrs. Rogers	94	" You 'll ring the bell if you want anything , Miss ? "
6955	6964	6952	6952	Vera	125	" She looks frightened of her own shadow . "
7005	7020	7001	7001	She	125	" I 'm Mrs. Owen 's new secretary . I expect you know that . "
7025	7052	7021	7022	Mrs. Rogers	94	" No , Miss , I do n't know anything . Just a list of the ladies and gentlemen and what rooms they were to have . "
7056	7064	7053	7053	Vera	125	" Mrs. Owen did n't mention me ? "
7071	7089	7065	7066	Mrs. Rogers	94	" I have n't seen Mrs. Owen not yet . We only came here two days ago . "
7090	7097	7099	7099	Vera	125	" Extraordinary people , these Owens , "
7105	7112	7102	7102	she	125	" What staff is there here ? "
7113	7120	7121	7121	Vera	125	" Just me and Rogers , Miss. "
7149	7181	7145	7146	Mrs. Rogers	94	" I 'm a good cook and Rogers is handy about the house . I did n't know , of course , that there was to be such a large party . "
7185	7191	7182	7182	Vera	125	" But you can manage ? "
7192	7220	7221	7221	Vera	125	" Oh , yes , Miss , I can manage . If there 's to be large parties often perhaps Mrs. Owen could get extra help in . "
7224	7229	7221	7221	Vera	125	" I expect so . "
7311	7329	7330	7330	She	125	" I wish I 'd seen the Owens ... I wish I knew what they were like . "
7916	7951	7913	7913	He	86	" All the same , this evening , I 'll imagine to myself that I 'm not going back that I 've done with London and Harley Street and all the rest of it . "
7995	8005	7992	7992	He	86	" I 'm leaving my ordinary life behind me . "
8180	8211	8173	8175	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Armstrong ? Remember him in the witness box . Very correct and cautious . All doctors are damned fools . Harley Street ones are the worst of the lot . "
8237	8244	8234	8234	he	55	" Drinks are in the hall . "
8249	8263	8245	8246	Dr. Armstrong	86	" I must go and pay my respects to my host and hostess . "
8279	8286	8268	8268	his	55	" You ca n't do that . "
8292	8296	8297	8298	The judge	338	" Why not ? "
8301	8319	8297	8298	The judge	338	" No host and hostess . Very curious state of affairs . Do n't understand this place . "
8345	8351	8341	8341	Wargrave	55	" D'you know Constance Culmington ? "
8352	8363	8373	8374	the judge	338	" Er no , I 'm afraid I do n't . "
8364	8371	8373	8374	the judge	338	" It 's of no consequence , "
8376	8398	8373	8374	the judge	338	" Very vague woman and practically unreadable handwriting . I was just wondering if I 'd come to the wrong house . "
8502	8513	8497	8498	the Judge	338	" Is Lady Constance Culmington expected , do you know ? "
8519	8529	8514	8514	Rogers	94	" No , sir , not to my knowledge . "
8544	8558	8537	8537	he	338	" Indian Island , eh ? There 's a nigger in the woodpile . "
8606	8616	8601	8601	He	92	" Must go through with it , I suppose , "
8728	8767	8725	8725	He	93	" Remember this island when I was a kid . Never thought I 'd be doing this sort of a job in a house here . Good thing , perhaps , that one ca n't foresee the future ... "
8952	9008	8947	8947	she	560	" The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken . The Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . The wicked shall be turned into hell . "
9182	9192	9177	9178	Anthony Marston	92	" Quaint , these things , are n't they ? "
9213	9216	9218	9218	Tony	90	" Indians . "
9220	9231	9232	9232	Vera	125	" Indian Island . I suppose that 's the idea . "
9236	9247	9232	9232	Vera	125	" I wonder . How many are there ? Ten ? "
9248	9254	9255	9255	Vera	125	" Yes ten there are . "
9258	9291	9255	9255	Vera	125	" What fun ! They 're the ten little Indian boys of the nursery rhyme , I suppose . In my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece . "
9295	9302	9292	9292	Lombard	71	" In my room , too . "
9303	9307	9353	9354	Vera Claythorne	125	" And mine . "
9308	9312	9313	9313	Everybody	257	" And mine . "
9321	9332	9318	9318	Vera	125	" It 's an amusing idea , is n't it ? "
9338	9342	9333	9335	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Remarkably childish , "
9399	9403	9395	9396	Emily Brent	76	" Pleasant sound . "
9408	9413	9404	9404	Vera	125	" I hate it . "
9433	9448	9427	9427	She	125	" I do n't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm . "
9453	9466	9467	9467	she	76	" I 've no doubt the house is shut up in winter , "
9470	9483	9484	9484	Vera	125	" You 'd never get servants to stay here for one thing . "
9487	9497	9484	9484	Vera	125	" It must be difficult to get servants anyway . "
9502	9520	9498	9499	Emily Brent	76	" Mrs. Oliver has been lucky to get these two . The woman 's a good cook . "
9524	9534	9535	9535	She	76	" Funny how elderly people always get names wrong . "
9538	9551	9535	9535	She	76	" Yes , I think Mrs. Owen has been very lucky indeed . "
9584	9592	9580	9580	She	76	" Owen ? Did you say Owen ? "
9593	9596	9597	9598	Emily Brent	76	" Yes . "
9602	9615	9597	9598	Emily Brent	76	" I 've never met any one called Owen in my life . "
9619	9622	9623	9623	She	125	" But surely "
9817	9826	9807	9808	The Voice	106	" Ladies and gentlemen ! Silence , please ! "
10172	10175	10169	10169	Lombard	71	" Marston . "
10221	10242	10217	10217	He	86	" It 's nothing . She 's fainted , that 's all . She 'll be round in a minute . "
10248	10253	10243	10243	Lombard	71	" Get some brandy . "
10266	10271	10254	10254	Rogers	94	" Yes , sir , "
10284	10298	10280	10280	Vera	125	" Who was that speaking ? Where was he ? It sounded it sounded "
10304	10320	10299	10300	General Macarthur	80	" What 's going on here ? What kind of a practical joke was that ? "
10449	10463	10446	10446	He	86	" That voice ? It sounded as though it were in the room . "
10467	10483	10464	10464	Vera	125	" Who was it ? Who was it ? It was n't one of us . "
10565	10572	10562	10562	He	71	" Ah , here we are . "
10672	10680	10681	10681	Vera	125	" You are charged with the following indictments "
10684	10697	10681	10681	Vera	125	" Turn it off ! Turn it off ! It 's horrible ! "
10711	10722	10701	10702	Dr. Armstrong	86	" A disgraceful and heartless practical joke , I suppose . "
10733	10745	10728	10730	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" So you think it 's a joke , do you ? "
10752	10759	10746	10747	The doctor	287	" What else could it be ? "
10774	10787	10771	10771	He	71	" At the moment I 'm not prepared to give an opinion . "
10796	10820	10793	10793	He	92	" Look here , there 's one thing you 've forgotten . Who the devil turned the thing on and set it going ? "
10824	10835	10836	10836	He	55	" Yes , I think we must inquire into that . "
10880	10910	10873	10873	Rogers	94	" Allow me , Madam , I 'll speak to her . Ethel Ethel it 's all right . All right , do you hear ? Pull yourself together . "
10944	10951	10940	10940	Rogers	94	" Pull yourself together , Ethel . "
10959	10975	10976	10976	She	94	" You 'll be all right now , Mrs. Rogers . Just a nasty turn . "
10979	10986	10976	10976	She	94	" Did I faint , sir ? "
10987	10990	10940	10940	Rogers	94	" Yes . "
10991	11002	11003	11003	Her	94	" It was The Voice that awful voice like a judgement "
11018	11024	11013	11014	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Where 's that brandy ? "
11052	11059	11043	11043	he	287	" Drink this , Mrs. Rogers . "
11085	11099	11082	11082	She	94	" I 'm all right now . It just gave me a turn . "
11104	11135	11100	11100	Rogers	94	" Of course it did . It gave me a turn too . Fair made me drop that tray . Wicked lies , it was ! I 'd like to know "
11177	11192	11174	11174	he	55	" Who put that record on the gramophone ? Was it you , Rogers ? "
11196	11228	11193	11193	Rogers	94	" I did n't know what it was . Before God , I did n't know what it was , sir . If I had I 'd never have done it . "
11234	11250	11229	11230	The judge	338	" That is probably true . But I think you 'd better explain , Rogers . "
11264	11277	11260	11260	He	459	" I was just obeying orders , sir , that 's all . "
11278	11282	11229	11230	The judge	338	" Whose orders ? "
11283	11288	11289	11291	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Mr. Owen 's . "
11294	11310	11289	11291	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Let me get this quite clear . Mr. Owen 's orders were what exactly ? "
11314	11353	11354	11355	The judge	338	" I was to put a record on the gramophone . I 'd find the record in the drawer and my wife was to start the gramophone when I 'd gone into the drawingroom with the coffee tray . "
11358	11364	11365	11365	Rogers	94	" A very remarkable story . "
11368	11413	11365	11365	Rogers	94	" It 's the truth , sir . I swear to God it 's the truth . I did n't know what it was not for a moment . It had a name on it I thought it was just a piece of music . "
11419	11427	11428	11428	Lombard	71	" Was there a title on it ? "
11444	11456	11441	11441	He	71	" Quite right , sir . It was entitled Swan Song ... "
11466	11493	11463	11463	He	80	" The whole thing is preposterous preposterous ! Slinging accusations about like this ! Something must be done about it . This fellow Owen whoever he is "
11502	11512	11498	11498	She	76	" That 's just it , who is he ? "
11535	11568	11532	11532	He	338	" That is exactly what we must go into very carefully . I should suggest that you get your wife to bed first of all , Rogers . Then come back here . "
11569	11574	11575	11576	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Yes , sir . "
11579	11589	11575	11576	Dr. Armstrong	86	" I 'll give you a hand , Rogers . "
11612	11629	11608	11609	Tony Marston	90	" Do n't know about you , sir , but I could do with a drink . "
11633	11637	11630	11630	Lombard	71	" I agree . "
11641	11648	11649	11649	He	90	" I 'll go and forage . "
11664	11679	11656	11656	He	90	" Found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought in . "
11736	11742	11743	11743	he	86	" She 's all right , "
11746	11769	11743	11743	he	86	" I 've given her a sedative to take . What 's that , a drink ? I could do with one . "
11810	11831	11806	11807	The judge	338	" Now then , Rogers , we must get to the bottom of this . Who is this Mr. Owen ? "
11835	11843	11832	11832	Rogers	94	" He owns this place , sir . "
11844	11868	11869	11869	Rogers	94	" I am aware of that fact . What I want you to tell me is what you yourself know about the man . "
11874	11891	11871	11871	his	628	" I ca n't say , sir . You see , I 've never seen him . "
11905	11916	11901	11902	General Macarthur	80	" You 've never seen him ? What d'yer mean ? "
11917	11950	11951	11951	Blore	93	" We 've only been here just under a week , sir , my wife and I. We were engaged by letter , through an agency . The Regina Agency in Plymouth . "
11954	11959	11960	11960	he	93	" Old established firm , "
11966	11973	11963	11963	Wargrave	55	" Have you got that letter ? "
11974	11990	11901	11902	General Macarthur	80	" The letter engaging us ? No , sir . I did n't keep it . "
11991	12009	11901	11902	General Macarthur	80	" Go on with your story . You were engaged , as you say , by letter . "
12010	12049	11963	11963	Wargrave	55	" Yes , sir . We were to arrive on a certain day . We did . Everything was in order here . Plenty of food in stock and everything very nice . Just needed dusting and that . "
12050	12054	11901	11902	General Macarthur	80	" What next ? "
12055	12119	12120	12121	The judge	338	" Nothing , sir . We got orders by letter again to prepare the rooms for a houseparty and then yesterday by the afternoon post I got another letter from Mr. Owen . It said he and Mrs. Owen were detained and to do the best we could and it gave the instructions about dinner and coffee and putting on the gramophone record . "
12125	12133	12120	12121	The judge	338	" Surely you 've got that letter ? "
12134	12145	12146	12146	He	631	" Yes , sir , I 've got it here . "
12158	12161	12162	12162	he	338	" H'm , "
12165	12172	12162	12162	he	338	" Headed Ritz Hotel and typewritten . "
12185	12196	12182	12182	He	93	" If you 'll just let me have a look . "
12217	12252	12214	12214	He	93	" Coronation machine . Quite new no defects . Ensign paper the most widely used make . You wo n't get anything out of that . Might be fingerprints , but I doubt it . "
12275	12294	12272	12272	He	92	" Got some fancy Christian names , has n't he ? Ulick Norman Owen . Quite a mouthful . "
12295	12305	12272	12272	He	92	" The old judge said with a slight start : "
12327	12347	12315	12315	You	93	" He looked round at the others and thrusting his neck forward like an angry tortoise , he said : "
12388	12396	12397	12397	We	633	" He paused and then went on . "
12423	12438	12410	12413	each one of us	638	" There was a moment 's pause and then Emily Brent spoke with decision . "
12448	12452	12453	12453	I	0	" she said . "
12537	12543	12535	12535	Owen	122	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said : "
12552	12553	12549	12550	Miss Brent	76	" "
12563	12584	12585	12585	I	0	" She went away and returned a minute later with the letter . The judge read it . He said : "
12593	12607	12590	12591	Miss Claythorne	125	" Vera explained the circumstances of her secretarial engagement . The judge said : "
12610	12614	12608	12608	Marston	123	" Anthony said : "
12653	12661	12662	12663	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Again Wargrave nodded . He said : "
12665	12666	12662	12663	Dr. Armstrong	86	" "
12673	12674	12667	12667	I	0	" "
12687	12688	12678	12678	You	0	" "
12701	12706	12691	12694	A colleague of mine	644	" The judge said : "
12728	12729	12714	12715	that colleague	645	" "
12734	12747	12714	12715	that colleague	645	" Lombard , who had been staring at Blore , said suddenly : "
12757	12764	12751	12751	I	0	" The judge lifted a hand . "
12768	12769	12751	12751	I	0	" "
12772	12773	12771	12771	I	0	" "
12807	12817	12804	12805	General Macarthur	80	" Pulling at his moustache , the General muttered : "
12853	12857	12858	12859	Mr. Lombard	97	" Wargrave said : "
12861	12887	12858	12859	Mr. Lombard	97	" Lombard 's brain had been active . Was he to come out in the open , or not ? He made up his mind . "
12893	12897	12858	12859	Mr. Lombard	97	" he said . "
12918	12945	12911	12911	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave turned his attention to Mr. Blore . His forefinger stroked his upper lip and his voice was dangerously polite . He said : "
13036	13041	13042	13042	Cat	126	" Blore said sulkily : "
13065	13066	13063	13063	Davis	98	" "
13073	13074	13069	13071	William Henry Blore	93	" "
13079	13080	13069	13071	William Henry Blore	93	" "
13086	13090	13069	13071	William Henry Blore	93	" said Lombard . "
13155	13181	13137	13137	I	0	" All eyes were turned on Blore . Angry suspicious eyes . Anthony Marston moved a step nearer to him . His fists clenched themselves . "
13188	13192	13185	13186	you swine	654	" he said . "
13196	13208	13185	13186	you swine	654	" Blore flung back his head and set his square jaw . "
13216	13220	13209	13210	You gentlemen	655	" he said . "
13253	13259	13246	13246	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave asked : "
13263	13264	13265	13267	This man Owen	122	" "
13313	13314	13306	13306	I	0	" "
13319	13324	13325	13326	Mrs. Owen	95	" Blore said bitterly : "
13345	13360	13335	13335	I	0	" Again the forefinger of the judge stroked his lip , this time appreciatively . "
13370	13374	13361	13361	Your	0	" he said . "
13441	13445	13428	13429	U.N. Owen	127	" Vera cried : "
13452	13461	13401	13402	Una Nancy	66	" The judge nodded gently . He said : "
13489	13520	13481	13482	a madman	662	" Chapter 4 . There was a moment 's silence a silence of dismay and bewilderment . Then the judge 's small clear voice took up the thread once more . "
13548	13563	13537	13537	I	0	" He took a letter from his pocket and tossed it onto the table . "
13765	13773	13759	13760	General Macarthur	80	" He paused . Then he said : "
13799	13810	13792	13792	he	668	" Immediately a babel broke out . General Macarthur shouted : "
13819	13824	13811	13815	A pack of damn lies	675	" Vera cried out : "
13829	13835	13811	13815	A pack of damn lies	675	" Her breath came fast . "
13838	13843	13811	13815	A pack of damn lies	675	" Rogers said hoarsely : "
13857	13862	13855	13855	us	674	" Anthony Marston growled : "
13874	13895	13867	13869	the damned fool	676	" The upraised hand of Mr. Justice Wargrave calmed the tumult . He said , picking his words with care : "
14056	14100	14047	14047	I	0	" Armstrong was remembering now . The Seton case ! The verdict had come as a great surprise . He had met Matthews , K.C. , on one of the days of the trial dining at a restaurant . Matthews had been confident . "
14112	14121	14122	14122	Judge	684	" And then afterwards he had heard comments : "
14151	14152	14158	14158	he	557	" "
14167	14192	14158	14158	he	557	" All these memories rushed through the doctor 's mind . Before he could consider the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsively : "
14207	14224	14200	14200	I	0	" The hooded reptilian eyes met his . In a clear cold voice the judge said : "
14235	14241	14242	14243	The fellow	685	" Armstrong said to himself : "
14252	14264	14265	14265	I	0	" Vera Claythorne spoke in a trembling voice . She said : "
14371	14388	14348	14348	she	691	" She broke down , weeping bitterly . General Macarthur patted her shoulder . He said : "
14430	14443	14468	14468	he	688	" He stood erect , squaring his shoulders . He barked out : "
14524	14560	14520	14520	Caesar	130	" General Macarthur sat down . His shaking hand pulled at his moustache . The effort to speak had cost him a good deal . Lombard spoke . His eyes were amused . He said : "
14564	14568	14520	14520	Caesar	130	" Marston said : "
14573	14578	14571	14571	them	702	" Philip Lombard grinned . "
14615	14621	14599	14599	I	0	" General Macarthur said sternly : "
14631	14635	14622	14622	You	0	" Lombard said : "
14678	14694	14695	14695	You	0	" Vera lifted her face from her hands . She said , staring at him : "
14701	14705	14695	14695	You	0	" Lombard answered : "
14712	14731	14706	14706	I	0	" His amused eyes looked into her horrified ones . Anthony Marston said in a slow puzzled voice : "
14759	14766	14790	14790	you	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said acidly : "
14774	14778	14790	14790	you	0	" Anthony said : "
14833	14839	14840	14841	This speeding	715	" Dr. Armstrong said warmly : "
14859	14868	14869	14869	Speed	132	" Anthony shrugged his shoulders . He said : "
14893	14930	14938	14938	my	0	" He looked round vaguely for his glass , picked it up off a table and went over to the side table and helped himself to another whiskey and soda . He said over his shoulder : "
14945	14970	14972	14972	I	0	" The manservant , Rogers , had been moistening his lips and twisting his hands . He said now in a low deferential voice : "
14981	14985	14979	14979	sir	1891	" Lombard said : "
14991	15007	14989	14989	Rogers	94	" Rogers cleared his throat and passed his tongue once more over his dry lips . "
15155	15194	15220	15220	her	133	" Lombard looked thoughtfully at the man 's twitching face , his dry lips , the fright in his eyes . He remembered the crash of the falling coffee tray . He thought , but did not say , "
15199	15213	15220	15220	her	133	" Blore spoke spoke in his hearty bullying official manner . He said : "
15227	15237	15238	15239	Miss Brady	133	" Rogers drew himself up . He said stiffly : "
15261	15265	15255	15255	I	0	" Lombard said : "
15273	15274	15268	15268	yourself	0	" "
15279	15280	15277	15277	me	0	" "
15289	15294	15295	15295	Landor	111	" Blore went purple . "
15309	15318	15319	15319	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave stirred . He said : "
15353	15357	15358	15358	I	0	" Blore said : "
15361	15362	15358	15358	I	0	" "
15383	15387	15388	15388	He	111	" Blore said : "
15411	15416	15417	15417	You	0	" Wargrave said slowly : "
15432	15437	15417	15417	You	0	" Blore said sulkily : "
15443	15451	15417	15417	You	0	" He added in a thick voice : "
15459	15470	15456	15456	my	0	" Lombard laughed a sudden ringing laugh . He said : "
15503	15533	15534	15534	I	0	" Emily Brent glanced at him in sharp distaste and drew herself away a little . Dr. Armstrong , very much master of himself , shook his head goodhumouredly . "
15544	15548	15534	15534	I	0	" he said . "
15648	15659	15638	15638	they	740	" He sighed , shaking his head . He thought : "
15744	15790	15715	15715	she	746	" There was a silence in the room . Everybody was looking , covertly or openly , at Emily Brent . It was a minute or two before she became aware of the expectation . Her eyebrows rose on her narrow forehead . She said : "
15806	15811	15800	15800	I	0	" The judge said : "
15817	15818	15814	15815	Miss Brent	76	" "
15821	15837	15838	15838	You	76	" Her lips closed tightly . The judge stroked his face . He said mildly : "
15843	15849	15838	15838	You	76	" Miss Brent said coldly : "
15879	15919	15870	15870	I	0	" There was an unsatisfied feeling in the air . But Emily Brent was not one to be swayed by public opinion . She sat unyielding . The judge cleared his throat once or twice . Then he said : "
15944	15945	15946	15946	Nobody	371	" "
15954	15955	15950	15952	Nobody at all	753	" "
15962	15963	15967	15967	sir	1891	" "
15969	15973	15967	15967	sir	1891	" Wargrave said : "
16017	16048	16049	16049	Rogers	94	" He may be dangerous . In my opinion it would be well for us to leave this place as soon as possible . I suggest that we leave tonight . "
16052	16069	16049	16049	Rogers	94	" I beg your pardon , sir , but there 's no boat on the island . "
16070	16076	16049	16049	Rogers	94	" No boat at all ? "
16077	16082	16049	16049	Rogers	94	" No , sir . "
16083	16092	16049	16049	Rogers	94	" How do you communicate with the mainland ? "
16093	16121	16122	16124	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Fred Narracott , he comes over every morning , sir . He brings the bread and the milk and the post , and takes the orders . "
16127	16150	16122	16124	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Then in my opinion it would be well if we all left tomorrow morning as soon as Narracott 's boat arrives . "
16173	16180	16181	16181	he	92	" A bit unsporting , what ? "
16184	16206	16181	16181	he	92	" Ought to ferret out the mystery before we go . Whole thing 's like a detective story . Positively thrilling . "
16212	16233	16207	16208	The judge	338	" At my time of life , I have no desire for ' thrills , ' as you call them . "
16240	16258	16234	16234	Anthony	92	" The legal life 's narrowing ! I 'm all for crime ! Here 's to it . "
16371	16379	16363	16363	He	92	" My God ! he 's dead ! "
16477	16490	16473	16474	General Macarthur	80	" Dead : D'you mean the fellow just choked and and died ? "
16495	16512	16513	16513	He	86	" You can call it choking if you like . He died of asphyxiation right enough . "
16550	16565	16546	16547	General Macarthur	80	" Never knew a man could die like that just of a choking fit ! "
16574	16585	16566	16567	Emily Brent	76	" In the midst of life we are in death . "
16595	16621	16591	16591	He	86	" No , a man does n't die of a mere choking fit . Marston 's death was n't what we call a natural death . "
16629	16637	16622	16622	Vera	125	" Was there something in the whiskey ? "
16641	16674	16675	16676	The judge	338	" Yes . Ca n't say exactly . Everything points to one of the cyanides . No distinctive smell of Prussic Acid , probably Potassium Cyanide . It acts pretty well instantaneously . "
16680	16687	16675	16676	The judge	338	" It was in his glass ? "
16688	16691	16692	16693	The doctor	287	" Yes . "
16728	16735	16723	16723	He	86	" They 're both all right . "
16739	16753	16736	16736	Lombard	71	" You mean he must have put the stuff in his glass himself ! "
16765	16770	16762	16762	He	86	" Seems like it . "
16774	16785	16771	16771	Blore	93	" Suicide , eh ? That 's a queer go . "
16790	16834	16786	16786	Vera	125	" You 'd never think that he would kill himself . He was so alive . He was oh enjoying himself ! When he came down the hill in his car this evening he looked he looked oh , I ca n't explain ! "
16880	16889	16876	16877	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Is there any possibility other than suicide ? "
16955	16983	16951	16951	Blore	93	" You know , doctor , it does n't seem right to me . I should n't have said Mr. Marston was a suicidal type of gentleman . "
16987	16991	16984	16984	Armstrong	86	" I agree . "
17061	17073	17057	17058	Emily Brent	76	" We 'd better go to bed . It 's late . "
17109	17118	17105	17106	The judge	338	" Yes , we must get some sleep . "
17122	17132	17119	17119	Rogers	94	" I have n't cleared yet in the diningroom . "
17137	17144	17133	17133	Lombard	71	" Do it in the morning . "
17150	17157	17145	17145	Armstrong	86	" Is your wife all right ? "
17158	17167	17168	17168	He	86	" I 'll go and see , sir . "
17176	17183	17168	17168	He	86	" Sleeping beautiful , she is . "
17184	17187	17189	17190	the doctor	287	" Good , "
17192	17198	17189	17190	the doctor	287	" Do n't disturb her . "
17199	17229	17230	17230	He	86	" No , sir . I 'll just put things straight in the diningroom and make sure everything 's locked up right , and then I 'll turn in . "
17732	17749	17727	17727	He	804	" That 's a rum go ! I could have sworn there were ten of them . "
17819	17822	17812	17812	her	140	" Dull ! "
18100	18105	18098	18098	his	113	" Yes , sir . "
18293	18314	18288	18288	People	1846	" Old Macarthur lost his nerve a bit , made some colossal blunders , sacrificed some of his best men . "
18864	18874	18861	18861	He	141	" I wonder when we shall get away again . "
18960	18967	18957	18957	He	141	" Peaceful sound . Peaceful place ... "
18971	18997	18968	18968	He	141	" Best of an island is once you get there you ca n't go any further ... you 've come to the end of things ... "
19046	19068	19042	19042	She	125	" Hugo ... Hugo ... Why do I feel you 're so near to me tonight ? ... Somewhere quite close ... "
19095	19152	19153	19153	I	0	" It was no good trying not to think of Hugo . He was close to her . She had to think of him to remember ... Cornwall ... The black rocks , the smooth yellow sand . Mrs. Hamilton , stout , goodhumoured . Cyril , whining a little always , pulling at her hand . "
19175	19193	19168	19168	I	0	" Looking up meeting Hugo 's eyes watching her . The evenings after Cyril was in bed ... "
19203	19204	19200	19201	Miss Claythorne	125	" "
19211	19236	19208	19208	I	0	" The decorous stroll down to the beach . The moonlight the soft Atlantic air . And then , Hugo 's arm round her . "
19253	19266	19251	19251	Vera	125	" Yes , she knew . ( Or thought she knew . ) "
19334	19358	19359	19359	I	0	" If the child has been a girl , Hugo would have come into everything . He 'd been disappointed , he admitted . "
19399	19457	19392	19392	I	0	" And he was fond of him , too . Always ready to play games or amuse his small nephew . No rancour in Hugo 's nature . Cyril was n't really strong . A puny child no stamina . The kind of child , perhaps , who would n't live to grow up ... And then ? "
19470	19475	19458	19459	Miss Claythorne	125	" Irritating whiney repetition . "
19483	19484	19481	19481	Cyril	69	" "
19490	19508	19487	19488	Miss Claythorne	125	" Vera got up . She went to the dressingtable and swallowed three aspirins . She thought : "
19518	19522	19487	19488	Miss Claythorne	125	" She thought : "
19543	19595	19530	19530	I	0	" She shuddered as she remembered Anthony Marston 's convulsed purple face . As she passed the mantelpiece , she looked up at the framed doggerel . Ten little Indian boys went out to dine ; One choked his little self and then there were nine . She thought to herself : "
19605	19857	19601	19601	us	859	" Why had Anthony Marston wanted to die ? She did n't want to die . She could n't imagine wanting to die ... Death was for the other people ... Chapter 6 . Dr. Armstrong was dreaming ... It was very hot in the operating room ... Surely they 'd got the temperature too high ? The sweat was rolling down his face . His hands were clammy . Difficult to hold the scalpel firmly ... How beautifully sharp it was ... Easy to do a murder with a knife like that . And of course he was doing a murder ... The woman 's body looked different . It had been a large unwieldy body . This was a spare meagre body . And the face was hidden . Who was it that he had to kill ? He could n't remember . But he must know ! Should he ask Sister ? Sister was watching him . No , he could n't ask her . She was suspicious , he could see that . But who was it on the operating table ? They should n't have covered up the face like that ... If he could only see the face ... Ah ! that was better . A young probationer was pulling off the handkerchief . Emily Brent , of course . It was Emily Brent that he had to kill . How malicious her eyes were ! Her lips were moving . What was she saying ? "
19868	20046	20047	20048	Doctor doctor	861	" She was laughing now . No , nurse , do n't put the handkerchief back . I 've got to see . I 've got to give the anaesthetic . Where 's the ether ? I must have brought the ether with me . What have you done with the ether , Sister ? Chateau Neuf du Pape ? Yes , that will do quite as well . Take the handkerchief away , nurse . Of course ! I knew it all the time ! It 's Anthony Marston ! His face is purple and convulsed . But he 's not dead he 's laughing . I tell you he 's laughing ! He 's shaking the operating table . Look out , man , look out . Nurse , steady it steady it . With a start Dr. Armstrong woke up . It was morning . Sunlight was pouring into the room . And some one was leaning over him shaking him . It was Rogers . Rogers , with a white face , saying : "
20050	20067	20047	20048	Doctor doctor	861	" Dr. Armstrong woke up completely . He sat up in bed . He said sharply : "
20072	20073	20047	20048	Doctor doctor	861	" "
20110	20171	20102	20102	she	862	" Dr. Armstrong was quick and efficient . He wrapped himself in his dressinggown and followed Rogers . He bent over the bed where the woman was lying peacefully on her side . He lifted the cold hand , raised the eyelid . It was some few minutes before he straightened himself and turned from the bed . Rogers whispered : "
20177	20189	20175	20175	she	862	" He passed a tongue over dry lips . Armstrong nodded . "
20196	20231	20192	20192	she	862	" His eyes rested thoughtfully on the man before him . Then they went to the table by the bed , to the washstand , then back to the sleeping woman . Rogers said : "
20243	20258	20241	20241	doctor	737	" Dr. Armstrong was a minute or two before replying . Then he said : "
20266	20270	20271	20271	She	862	" Rogers said : "
20277	20278	20279	20280	Any doctor	866	" "
20286	20287	20288	20288	Doctor	737	" "
20290	20294	20288	20288	Doctor	737	" Rogers stared . "
20306	20307	20304	20304	us	869	" "
20320	20321	20308	20308	You	737	" "
20332	20336	20326	20326	I	0	" Armstrong said : "
20342	20365	20338	20338	she	862	" Now Rogers ' eyes evaded his . The man 's hands came together and turned and twisted uneasily . He muttered . "
20374	20380	20366	20366	She	862	" The doctor said sharply : "
20390	20398	20382	20382	she	862	" Rogers stared at him , surprised . "
20420	20498	20416	20416	she	862	" Armstrong went over to the washstand . There were a certain number of bottles on it . Hair lotion , lavender water , cascara , glycerine of cucumber for the hands , a mouthwash , toothpaste and some Elliman 's . Rogers helped by pulling out the drawers of the dressingtable . From there they moved on to the chest of drawers . But there was no sign of sleeping draughts or tablets . Rogers said : "
20515	20590	20416	20416	she	862	" When the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found every one up and awaiting the summons . General Macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside , exchanging desultory comments on the political situation . Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard had been up to the summit of the island behind the house . There they had discovered William Henry Blore , standing staring at the mainland . He said : "
20606	20612	20599	20599	I	0	" Vera said , smiling : "
20624	20641	20599	20599	I	0	" Philip Lombard was looking the other way , out to sea . He said abruptly : "
20649	20659	20643	20643	d'you	874	" Glancing up at the sky , Blore remarked : "
20666	20679	20643	20643	d'you	874	" Lombard pursed up his mouth into a whistle . He said : "
20692	20696	20643	20643	d'you	874	" Blore said : "
20700	20715	20643	20643	d'you	874	" From below them came the boom of a gong . Philip Lombard said : "
20726	20743	20744	20744	You	0	" As they went down the steep slope Blore said to Lombard in a ruminating voice : "
20769	20784	20760	20760	I	0	" Vera was a little ahead . Lombard hung back slightly . He said : "
20790	20791	20792	20792	I	0	" "
20811	20828	20808	20808	he	875	" Emily Brent came out of the drawingroom window to meet them . She said sharply : "
20834	20835	20808	20808	he	875	" "
20839	20888	20889	20890	That man	877	" said Vera . They went in to breakfast . There was a vast dish of eggs and bacon on the sideboard and tea and coffee . Rogers held the door open for them to pass in , then shut it from the outside . Emily Brent said : "
20896	20914	20889	20890	That man	877	" Dr. Armstrong , who was standing by the window , cleared his throat . He said : "
20950	20956	20937	20938	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Emily Brent said sharply : "
20965	20971	20937	20938	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Dr. Armstrong said easily : "
20998	21088	21089	21089	I	0	" They took the hint . Plates were filled , coffee and tea was poured . The meal began . Discussion of the island was , by mutual consent , tabooed . They spoke instead in a desultory fashion of current events . The news from abroad , events in the world of sport , the latest reappearance of the Loch Ness monster . Then , when plates were cleared , Dr. Armstrong moved back his chair a little , cleared his throat importantly and spoke . He said : "
21118	21129	21111	21112	Mrs. Rogers	94	" There were startled and shocked ejaculations . Vera exclaimed : "
21142	21159	21111	21112	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Mr. Justice Wargrave , his eyes narrowed , said in his small precise clear voice : "
21170	21176	21111	21112	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Armstrong shrugged his shoulders . "
21182	21183	21111	21112	Mrs. Rogers	94	" "
21190	21191	21192	21192	I	0	" "
21213	21217	21218	21218	She	464	" Vera said : "
21243	21249	21250	21250	Her	464	" Dr. Armstrong said drily : "
21266	21284	21250	21250	Her	464	" One word fell from Emily Brent . It fell hard and clear into the listening group . "
21287	21296	21250	21250	Her	464	" she said . Armstrong turned to her . "
21308	21320	21305	21306	Miss Brent	76	" Emily Brent , her lips tight and hard , said : "
21345	21346	21348	21348	you	884	" "
21351	21356	21348	21348	you	884	" Emily Brent said : "
21401	21409	21395	21395	She	464	" Dr. Armstrong shook his head doubtfully . "
21416	21420	21395	21395	She	464	" he said . "
21441	21447	21452	21452	you	884	" Emily Brent said quietly . "
21460	21471	21458	21458	God	135	" Every one looked shocked . Mr. Blore said uneasily : "
21483	21500	21480	21481	Miss Brent	76	" She looked at them with shining eyes . Her chin went up . She said : "
21523	21538	21539	21539	My	0	" The judge stroked his chin . He murmured in a slightly ironic voice : "
21575	21586	21589	21589	she	891	" Emily Brent shrugged her shoulders . Blore said sharply : "
21604	21608	21589	21589	she	891	" Armstrong said : "
21611	21612	21589	21589	she	891	" "
21645	21646	21647	21647	Rogers	94	" "
21655	21656	21647	21647	Rogers	94	" "
21659	21663	21647	21647	Rogers	94	" said Blore . "
21670	21688	21665	21665	he	891	" His tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply . Philip Lombard said : "
21695	21700	21692	21692	your	0	" Blore said aggressively : "
21768	21779	21758	21758	They	898	" Vera interrupted . In a low voice she said : "
21792	21801	21786	21787	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Blore looked slightly annoyed at the interruption . "
21807	21815	21804	21805	a woman	471	" his glance said . He resumed : "
21903	22038	22039	22039	Armstrong	86	" And there 's the position for you ! They 've done a murder and got away with it . But if the whole thing 's going to be raked up , what 's going to happen ? Ten to one , the woman will give the show away . She has n't got the nerve to stand up and brazen it out . She 's a living danger to her husband , that 's what she is . He 's all right . He 'll lie with a straight face till kingdom comes but he ca n't be sure of her ! And if she goes to pieces , his neck 's in danger ! So he slips something into a cup of tea and makes sure that her mouth is shut permanently . "
22043	22062	22039	22039	Armstrong	86	" There was no empty cup by her bedside there was nothing there at all . I looked . "
22066	22099	22063	22063	Blore	93	" Of course there would n't be ! First thing he 'd do when she 'd drunk it would be to take that cup and saucer away and wash it up carefully . "
22111	22134	22106	22107	General Macarthur	80	" It may be so . But I should hardly think it possible that a man would do that to his wife . "
22144	22165	22141	22141	He	93	" When a man 's neck 's in danger , he does n't stop to think too much about sentiment . "
22195	22235	22185	22185	He	93	" Is there anything more I can get you ? I 'm sorry there was so little toast , but we 've run right out of bread . The new bread has n't come over from the mainland yet . "
22249	22260	22246	22246	He	55	" What time does the motor boat usually come over ? "
22261	22299	22300	22301	Philip Lombard	71	" Between seven and eight , sir . Sometimes it 's a bit after eight . Do n't know what Fred Narracott can be doing this morning . If he 's ill he 'd send his brother . "
22304	22311	22300	22301	Philip Lombard	71	" What 's the time now ? "
22312	22320	22321	22321	Lombard	71	" Ten minutes to ten , sir . "
22346	22363	22339	22340	General Macarthur	80	" Sorry to hear about your wife , Rogers . Doctor 's just been telling us . "
22369	22379	22380	22380	He	71	" Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . "
22404	22409	22400	22401	Philip Lombard	71	" About this motor boat "
22423	22462	22420	22420	He	93	" I know what you 're thinking , Mr. Lombard . I 've asked myself the same question . Motor boat ought to have been here nigh on two hours ago . It has n't come ? Why ? "
22463	22468	22470	22470	Lombard	71	" Found the answer ? "
22472	22501	22470	22470	Lombard	71	" It 's not an accident that 's what I say . It 's part and parcel of the whole business . It 's all bound up together . "
22506	22515	22502	22503	Philip Lombard	71	" It wo n't come , you think ? "
22526	22534	22535	22535	he	71	" The motor boat 's not coming , "
22551	22559	22538	22538	Blore	93	" You think not too , General ? "
22565	22624	22560	22561	General Macarthur	80	" Of course it wo n't come . We 're counting on the motor boat to take us off the island . That 's the meaning of the whole business . We 're not going to leave the island ... None of us will ever leave ... Il 's the end , you see the end of everything ... "
22637	22660	22629	22629	he	71	" That 's peace real peace . To come to the end not to have to go on ... Yes , peace ... "
22713	22736	22710	22710	Blore	93	" There goes another one who 's balmy ! Looks as though it 'll end with the whole lot going that way . "
22741	22751	22737	22738	Philip Lombard	71	" I do n't fancy you will , Blore . "
22758	22771	22772	22772	He	912	" It would take a lot to send me off my head . "
22776	22793	22772	22772	He	912	" And I do n't think you 'll be going that way either , Mr. Lombard . "
22798	22810	22794	22795	Philip Lombard	71	" I feel quite sane at the minute , thank you . "
22874	22887	22866	22866	Rogers	94	" Could I have a word with you , sir , please ? "
22935	22953	22954	22955	The doctor	287	" Please , sir , if I could have a word with you . Inside , sir . "
22970	22982	22967	22967	He	86	" What 's the matter , man ? Pull yourself together . "
22983	22993	22994	22994	He	86	" In here , sir , come in here . "
23015	23018	23020	23020	Armstrong	86	" Well , "
23022	23027	23020	23020	Armstrong	86	" what is it ? "
23044	23059	23060	23060	Armstrong	86	" There 's things going on , sir , that I do n't understand . "
23064	23070	23060	23060	Armstrong	86	" Things ? What things ? "
23071	23114	23060	23060	Armstrong	86	" You 'll think I 'm crazy , sir . You 'll say it is n't anything . But it 's got to be explained , sir . It 's got to be explained . Because it does n't make any sense . "
23115	23134	23135	23135	Rogers	94	" Well , man , tell me what it is ? Do n't go on talking in riddles . "
23142	23180	23139	23139	He	86	" It 's those little figures , sir . In the middle of the table . The little china figures . Ten of them , there were . I 'll swear to that , ten of them . "
23184	23197	23181	23181	Armstrong	86	" Yes , ten . We counted them last night at dinner . "
23202	23267	23198	23198	Rogers	94	" That 's just it , sir . Last night , when I was clearing up , there was n't but nine , sir . I noticed it and thought it queer . But that 's all I thought . And now , sir , this morning . I did n't notice when I laid the breakfast . I was upset and all that . "
23290	23313	23284	23284	you	1891	" There 's only eight , sir ! Only eight ! It does n't make sense , does it ? Only eight ... "
23406	23435	23402	23403	Emily Brent	76	" The man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of person . It is really very odd that he should be so late this morning . "
23457	23476	23451	23451	She	125	" You must keep cool . This is n't like you . You 've always had excellent nerves . "
23486	23499	23478	23478	she	125	" I wish he would come . I want to get away . "
23505	23514	23500	23501	Emily Brent	76	" I 've no doubt we all do . "
23518	23534	23515	23515	Vera	125	" It 's all so extraordinary ... There seems no no meaning in it all . "
23543	23581	23535	23539	The elderly woman beside her	931	" I 'm very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in . Really that letter is absurd when one comes to examine it . But I had no doubts at the time none at all . "
23586	23591	23582	23582	Vera	125	" I suppose not . "
23592	23601	23603	23604	Emily Brent	76	" One takes things for granted too much , "
23616	23627	23613	23613	She	125	" Do you really think what you said at breakfast ? "
23628	23646	23647	23647	Vera	125	" Be a little more precise , my dear . To what in particular are you referring ? "
23654	23671	23647	23647	Vera	125	" Do you really think that Rogers and his wife did away with that old lady ? "
23684	23699	23681	23681	she	76	" Personally , I am quite sure of it . What do you think ? "
23700	23709	23710	23711	Emily Brent	76	" I do n't know what to think . "
23714	23762	23710	23711	Emily Brent	76	" Everything goes to support the idea . The way the woman fainted . And the man dropped the coffee tray , remember . Then the way he spoke about it it did n't ring true . Oh , yes , I 'm afraid they did it . "
23766	23796	23763	23763	Vera	125	" The way she looked scared of her own shadow ! I 've never seen a woman look so frightened ... She must have been always haunted by it ... "
23801	23844	23797	23798	Miss Brent	76	" I remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' It 's very true , that . ' Be sure thy sin will find thee out . ' "
23854	23864	23851	23851	She	125	" But , Miss Brent Miss Brent in that case "
23865	23871	23935	23935	She	76	" Yes , my dear ? "
23872	23881	23935	23935	She	76	" The others ? What about the others ? "
23882	23890	23851	23851	She	125	" I do n't quite understand you . "
23891	23910	23911	23911	She	125	" All the other accusations they they were n't true ? But if it 's true about the Rogerses "
23938	23965	23935	23935	She	76	" Ah , I understand you now . Well , there is that Mr. Lombard . He admits to having abandoned twenty men to their deaths . "
23969	23975	23966	23966	Vera	125	" They were only natives ... "
23981	23991	23976	23977	Emily Brent	76	" Black or white , they are our brothers . "
23995	24020	23992	23992	Vera	125	" Our black brothers our black brothers . Oh , I 'm going to laugh . I 'm hysterical . I 'm not myself ... "
24026	24071	24072	24072	She	76	" Of course , some of the other accusations were very farfetched and ridiculous . Against the judge , for instance , who was only doing his duty in his public capacity , And the exScotland Yard man . My own case , too . "
24079	24107	24072	24072	She	76	" Naturally , considering the circumstances , I was not going to say anything last night . It was not a fit subject to discuss before gentlemen . "
24108	24111	24112	24112	Vera	125	" No ? "
24122	24207	24208	24208	She	76	" Beatrice Taylor was in service with me . Not a nice girl as I found out too late . I was very much deceived in her . She had nice manners and was very clean and willing . I was very pleased with her . Of course all that was the sheerest hypocrisy ! She was a loose girl with no morals . Disgusting ! It was some time before I found out that she was what they call ' in trouble . ' "
24219	24256	24257	24257	Vera	125	" It was a great shock to me . Her parents were decent folk , too , who had brought her up very strictly . I 'm glad to say they did not condone her behaviour . "
24265	24269	24257	24257	Vera	125	" What happened ? "
24270	24293	24294	24294	Vera	125	" Naturally I did not keep her an hour under my roof . No one shall ever say that I condoned immorality . "
24301	24307	24294	24294	Vera	125	" What happened to her ? "
24312	24339	24308	24309	Miss Brent	76	" The abandoned creature , not content with having one sin on her conscience , committed a still graver sin . She took her own life . "
24345	24350	24340	24340	Vera	125	" She killed herself ? "
24351	24361	24362	24362	Vera	125	" Yes , she threw herself into the river . "
24379	24404	24376	24376	She	76	" What did you feel like when you knew she 'd done that ? Were n't you sorry ? Did n't you blame yourself ? "
24411	24423	24424	24424	Vera	125	" I ? I had nothing with which to reproach myself . "
24427	24436	24424	24424	Vera	125	" But if your hardness drove her to it "
24442	24474	24475	24475	She	76	" Her own action her own sin that was what drove her to it . If she had behaved like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happened . "
24657	24669	24651	24651	He	86	" Lombard , can I speak to you for a minute ? "
24673	24677	24670	24670	Philip	71	" Of course . "
24704	24710	24701	24701	Armstrong	86	" I want a consultation . "
24720	24731	24717	24717	He	71	" My dear fellow , I 've no medical knowledge . "
24732	24745	24701	24701	Armstrong	86	" No , no , I mean as to the general situation . "
24746	24753	24754	24754	Armstrong	86	" Oh , that 's different . "
24757	24768	24754	24754	Armstrong	86	" Frankly , what do you think of the position ? "
24778	24788	24775	24775	he	71	" It 's rather suggestive , is n't it ? "
24789	24808	24809	24809	Philip	71	" What are your ideas on the subject of that woman ? Do you accept Blore 's theory ? "
24819	24827	24816	24816	He	71	" It 's perfectly feasible taken alone . "
24828	24831	24832	24832	Armstrong	86	" Exactly . "
24849	24894	24895	24895	Armstrong	86	" That is , accepting the premise that Mr. and Mrs. Rogers have successfully got away with murder in their time . And I do n't see why they should n't . What do you think they did exactly ? Poisoned the old lady ? "
24899	24980	24895	24895	Armstrong	86	" It might be simpler than that . I asked Rogers this morning what this Miss Brady had suffered from . His answer was enlightening . I do n't need to go into medical details , but in a certain form of cardiac trouble , amyl nitrite is used . When an attack comes on an ampoule of amyl nitrite is broken and it is inhaled . If amyl nitrite were withheld well , the consequences might easily be fatal . "
24986	24999	24981	24982	Philip Lombard	71	" As simple as that . It must have been rather tempting . "
25004	25044	25000	25001	The doctor	287	" Yes , no positive action . No arsenic to obtain and administer nothing definite just negation ! And Rogers hurried through the night to fetch a doctor and they both felt confident that no one could ever know . "
25045	25062	25064	25065	Philip Lombard	71	" And , even if any one knew , nothing could ever be proved against them , "
25071	25080	25067	25067	He	71	" Of course that explains a good deal . "
25086	25092	25093	25093	Lombard	71	" I beg your pardon . "
25096	25138	25093	25093	Lombard	71	" I mean it explains Indian Island . There are crimes that can not be brought home to their perpetrators . Instance , the Rogerses ' . Another instance , old Wargrave , who committed his murder strictly within the law . "
25143	25149	25139	25139	Armstrong	86	" You believe that story ? "
25154	25218	25150	25151	Philip Lombard	71	" Oh , yes , I believe it . Wargrave murdered Edward Seton all right , murdered him as surely as if he 'd stuck a stiletto through him ! But he was clever enough to do it from the judge 's seat in wig and gown . So in the ordinary way you ca n't bring his little crime home to him . "
25230	25248	25249	25250	Philip Lombard	71	" Murder in Hospital . Murder on the Operating Table . Safe yes , safe as houses ! "
25254	25262	25249	25250	Philip Lombard	71	" Hence Mr. Owen hence Indian Island ! "
25269	25289	25263	25263	Armstrong	86	" Now we 're getting down to it . What 's the real purpose of getting us all here ? "
25294	25300	25290	25291	Philip Lombard	71	" What do you think ? "
25305	25353	25301	25301	Armstrong	86	" Let 's go back a minute to this woman 's death . What are the possible theories ? Rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show away . Second possibility : She lost her nerve and took an easy way out herself . "
25358	25363	25354	25355	Philip Lombard	71	" Suicide , eh ? "
25364	25372	25373	25373	Lombard	71	" What do you say to that ? "
25376	25497	25498	25498	Armstrong	86	" It could have been yes if it had n't been for Marston 's death . Two suicides within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow ! And if you tell me that Anthony Marston , a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains , got the wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself out of the way well , the idea 's laughable ! And anyway , how did he get hold of the stuff ? From all I 've ever heard , Potassium Cyanide is n't the kind of stuff you take about with you in your waistcoat pocket . But that 's your line of country . "
25501	25527	25498	25498	Armstrong	86	" Nobody in their senses carries Potassium Cyanide . It might be done by some one who was going to take a wasps ' nest . "
25528	25578	25579	25579	Armstrong	86	" The ardent gardener or landowner , in fact ? Again , not Anthony Marston . It strikes me that Cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining . Either Anthony Marston meant to do away with himself before he came here , and therefore came prepared or else "
25583	25587	25579	25579	Armstrong	86	" Or else ? "
25592	25618	25588	25589	Philip Lombard	71	" Why make me say it ? When it 's on the tip of your own tongue . Anthony Marston was murdered , of course . "
25626	25631	25632	25632	Lombard	71	" And Mrs. Rogers ? "
25636	25716	25632	25632	Lombard	71	" I could believe in Anthony 's suicide ( with difficulty ) if it were n't for Mrs. Rogers . I could believe in Mrs. Rogers ' suicide ( easily ) if it were n't for Anthony Marston . I can believe that Rogers put his wife out of the way if it were not for the unexplained death of Anthony Marston . But what we need is a theory to explain two deaths following rapidly on each other . "
25720	25732	25717	25717	Armstrong	86	" I can perhaps give you some help towards that theory . "
25756	25782	25753	25753	Lombard	71	" Yes , little china Indian figures ... There were certainly ten last night at dinner . And now there are eight , you say ? "
25787	25808	25783	25784	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Ten little Indian boys going out to dine ; One went and choked himself and then there were nine . "
25827	25845	25818	25818	One	270	" The two men looked at each other . Philip Lombard grinned and flung away his cigarette . "
25876	25877	25871	25871	herself	153	" "
25881	25890	25871	25871	herself	153	" said Armstrong . Lombard took him up . "
25918	25919	25912	25916	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	957	" "
25922	25930	25912	25916	One Unknown Lunatic at Large	957	" Armstrong breathed a sigh of relief . "
25959	25960	25961	25961	Rogers	94	" "
25971	25977	25967	25967	Rogers	94	" Armstrong shook his head . "
26000	26008	25991	25991	He	557	" Philip Lombard nodded . He said : "
26043	26052	26040	26040	his	56	" Armstrong had gone pale . He said : "
26063	26078	26059	26061	a raving maniac	967	" Philip Lombard said , and there was a new ring in his voice : "
26089	26090	26083	26084	Mr. Owen	56	" "
26095	26096	26083	26084	Mr. Owen	56	" "
26126	26132	26124	26124	Esq	154	" Dr. Armstrong said warningly : "
26138	26143	26133	26133	He	56	" Philip Lombard laughed . "
26166	26172	26173	26173	We	970	" He paused and said : "
26232	26250	26210	26210	I	0	" Chapter 8 . Blore was easily roped in . He expressed immediate agreement with their arguments . "
26301	26302	26304	26304	yourself	976	" "
26308	26309	26304	26304	yourself	976	" "
26356	26373	26337	26337	he	123	" Armstrong shook his head . He stressed the point about the Cyanide . Blore agreed . "
26403	26407	26401	26401	sir	1891	" Lombard said : "
26497	26502	26484	26484	Somebody	982	" Blore said unbelievingly : "
26511	26516	26484	26484	Somebody	982	" Lombard said drily : "
26524	26529	26484	26484	Somebody	982	" Armstrong said slowly : "
26568	26574	26560	26560	I	0	" Blore shrugged his shoulders . "
26615	26619	26620	26620	I	0	" Lombard said : "
26625	26645	26620	26620	I	0	" He patted his pocket . Blore 's eyes opened very wide . He said in an overcasual tone : "
26655	26659	26620	26620	I	0	" Lombard said : "
26673	26674	26662	26662	I	0	" "
26677	26683	26662	26662	I	0	" said Blore and added : "
26730	26734	26710	26710	he	990	" Armstrong coughed . "
26756	26760	26761	26761	I	0	" Blore said : "
26778	26956	26775	26776	Dr. Armstrong	86	" The three men started on their tour of the island . It proved unexpectedly simple . On the northwest side , towards the coast , the cliffs fell sheer to the sea below , their surface unbroken . On the rest of the island there were no trees and very little cover . The three men worked carefully and methodically , beating up and down from the highest point to the water 's edge , narrowly scanning the least irregularity in the rock which might point to the entrance to a cave . But there were no caves . They came at last , skirting the water 's edge , to where General Macarthur sat looking out to sea . It was very peaceful here with the lap of the waves breaking over the rocks . The old man sat very upright , his eyes fixed on the horizon . He paid no attention to the approach of the searchers . His oblivion of them made one at least faintly uncomfortable . Blore thought to himself : "
26972	26985	26963	26963	he	995	" He cleared his throat and said in a wouldbe conversational tone : "
26997	27014	26989	26989	you	995	" The General frowned . He cast a quick look over his shoulder . He said : "
27034	27039	27024	27024	I	0	" Blore said genially : "
27075	27082	27083	27083	You	995	" The General frowned and said : "
27098	27112	27113	27113	He	608	" Blore retreated . He said , as he joined the other two : "
27125	27132	27135	27135	he	608	" Lombard asked with some curiosity : "
27138	27144	27135	27135	he	608	" Blore shrugged his shoulders . "
27161	27169	27135	27135	he	608	" Dr. Armstrong frowned . He murmured : "
27174	27212	27135	27135	he	608	" The search of the island was practically completed . The three men stood on the highest point looking over towards the mainland . There were no boats out . The wind was freshening . Lombard said : "
27242	27246	27235	27235	We	1005	" Blore said : "
27254	27260	27235	27235	We	1005	" Lombard said , frowning : "
27275	27276	27235	27235	We	1005	" "
27283	27284	27281	27281	sir	1891	" "
27331	27336	27381	27381	you	1003	" Blore said dubiously : "
27343	27348	27381	27381	you	1003	" Lombard said drily : "
27388	27393	27383	27383	they	391	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
27407	27421	27398	27398	I	0	" Philip Lombard , his lips curling back from his teeth , said : "
27436	27448	27429	27429	You	1003	" Blore was gazing down into the water . He said : "
27459	27465	27449	27449	Nobody	371	" Armstrong shook his head . "
27481	27485	27478	27478	he	1013	" Blore said : "
27509	27513	27478	27478	he	1013	" Lombard said : "
27531	27532	27478	27478	he	1013	" "
27538	27543	27478	27478	he	1013	" Lombard said suddenly : "
27591	27595	27582	27582	you	1022	" Blore said : "
27623	27665	27612	27612	I	0	" He started off briskly down to the house . Lombard stared up at the sky . The clouds were beginning to mass themselves together . The wind was increasing . He shot a sideways look at Armstrong . He said : "
27678	27683	27675	27675	you	1891	" Armstrong said slowly : "
27694	27954	27691	27691	Macarthur	80	" Vera had been restless all the morning . She had avoided Emily Brent with a kind of shuddering aversion . Miss Brent herself had taken a chair just round the corner of the house so as to be out of the wind . She sat there knitting . Every time Vera thought of her she seemed to see a pale drowned face with seaweed entangled in the hair ... A face that had once been pretty impudently pretty perhaps and which was now beyond the reach of pity or terror . And Emily Brent , placid and righteous , sat knitting . On the main terrace , Mr. Justice Wargrave sat huddled in a porter 's chair . His head was poked down well into his neck . When Vera looked at him , she saw a man standing in the dock a young man with fair hair and blue eyes and a bewildered , frightened face . Edward Seton . And in imagination she saw the judge 's old hands put the black cap on his head and begin to pronounce sentence ... After a while Vera strolled slowly down to the sea . She walked along towards the extreme end of the island where an old man sat staring out to the horizon . General Macarthur stirred at her approach . His head turned there was a queer mixture of questioning and apprehension in his look . It startled her . He stared intently at her for a minute or two . She thought to herself : "
27966	27970	27963	27963	he	1025	" He said : "
27981	27991	27977	27977	You	1026	" Vera sat down beside him . She said : "
28002	28009	27993	27993	you	1025	" He nodded his head gently . "
28012	28016	27993	27993	you	1025	" he said . "
28033	28034	28027	28027	I	0	" "
28038	28043	28027	28027	I	0	" said Vera sharply . "
28050	28055	28046	28046	you	1025	" He said gently : "
28086	28091	28094	28094	you	1025	" She said unsteadily : "
28097	28103	28094	28094	you	1025	" General Macarthur said gravely : "
28140	28145	28132	28132	you	1026	" Vera said wonderingly : "
28149	28153	28132	28132	you	1026	" He said : "
28210	28215	28216	28216	I	0	" Vera said hoarsely : "
28222	28242	28216	28216	I	0	" Her fingers worked spasmodically . She felt suddenly afraid of this quiet old soldier . He said musingly : "
28256	28261	28263	28263	Leslie	140	" Vera said questioningly : "
28267	28268	28263	28263	Leslie	140	" "
28293	28307	28285	28285	She	140	" He was silent for a minute or two , then he said : "
28321	28325	28317	28317	I	0	" Vera said : "
28328	28339	28317	28317	I	0	" and paused . General Macarthur nodded his head gently . "
28420	28429	28465	28465	you	1025	" In a hard voice , Vera said : "
28434	28449	28465	28465	you	1025	" He shook his head vaguely . He looked puzzled and a little distressed . "
28517	28521	28513	28513	I	0	" Vera said : "
28524	28543	28544	28544	You	1025	" and the echo of her voice came back to her from the rocks . General Macarthur said : "
28556	28565	28544	28544	You	1025	" Vera got up . She said sharply : "
28574	28578	28571	28571	you	0	" He said : "
28588	28589	28590	28590	You	1025	" "
28601	28626	28627	28627	Leslie	140	" General Macarthur looked out to sea again . He seemed unconscious of her presence behind him . He said very gently and softly : "
28630	28663	28627	28627	Leslie	140	" When Blore returned from the house with a rope coiled over his arm , he found Armstrong where he had left him staring down into the depths . Blore said breathlessly : "
28669	28674	28666	28667	Mr. Lombard	97	" Armstrong said carelessly : "
28700	28701	28696	28696	I	0	" "
28710	28718	28702	28702	I	0	" The doctor waved an impatient hand . "
28739	28740	28736	28737	old Macarthur	80	" "
28747	28753	28743	28743	him	80	" Dr. Armstrong said grimly : "
28767	28772	28773	28773	You	93	" Blore said incredulously : "
28779	28784	28785	28785	I	0	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
28829	28834	28818	28818	I	0	" Blore said doubtfully : "
28846	28863	28841	28841	I	0	" Armstrong cut in with a slight effort as of a man who pulls himself together . "
28889	28899	28887	28887	Lombard	97	" They fastened the rope carefully . Lombard said : "
28919	28938	28946	28946	he	97	" After a minute or two , while they stood together watching Lombard 's progress , Blore said : "
28948	28961	28946	28946	he	97	" There was something odd in his voice . Dr. Armstrong said : "
28975	28976	28965	28965	he	97	" "
28979	28991	28965	28965	he	97	" There was a silence and the ex - Inspector said : "
29004	29005	29001	29001	I	0	" "
29008	29009	29001	29001	I	0	" "
29017	29022	29010	29010	He	97	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
29027	29035	29010	29010	He	97	" Blore grunted . Then he said : "
29051	29056	29043	29043	I	0	" Dr. Armstrong said ; "
29066	29070	29057	29057	I	0	" Blore said : "
29085	29093	29057	29057	I	0	" He paused and then went on : "
29107	29111	29095	29095	you	0	" Armstrong stared . "
29123	29127	29121	29121	I	0	" Blore said : "
29133	29138	29130	29131	Mr. Lombard	97	" Armstrong said doubtfully : "
29143	29174	29139	29139	I	0	" Blore snorted . A sudden pull came on the rope . For some moments they had their hands full . Presently , when the strain relaxed , Blore said : "
29238	29289	29228	29228	people	1846	" Dr. Armstrong shook his head perplexedly . They leaned over and watched Lombard 's progress . His search was thorough and they could see at once that it was futile . Presently he came up over the edge of the cliff . He wiped the perspiration from his forehead . "
29292	29296	29297	29297	We	1047	" he said . "
29310	29408	29409	29410	Wonderful animal	1050	" The house was easily searched . They went through the few outbuildings first and then turned their attention to the building itself . Mrs. Rogers ' yard measure discovered in the kitchen dresser assisted them . But there were no hidden spaces left unaccounted for . Everything was plain and straightforward , a modern structure devoid of concealments . They went through the ground floor first . As they mounted to the bedroom floor , they saw through the landing window Rogers carrying out a tray of cocktails to the terrace . Philip Lombard said lightly : "
29423	29428	29429	29429	Rogers	94	" Armstrong said appreciatively : "
29442	29446	29435	29435	I	0	" Blore said : "
29461	29491	29435	29435	I	0	" They turned in to the first bedroom . Five minutes later they faced each other on the landing . No one hiding no possible hidingplace . Blore said : "
29499	29504	29435	29435	I	0	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
29514	29518	29435	29435	I	0	" Blore said : "
29545	29588	29744	29744	Rogers	94	" And it was then , as they stood there , that they heard the sound from above . A soft furtive footfall overhead . They all heard it . Armstrong grasped Blore 's arm . Lombard held up an admonitory finger . "
29592	29608	29609	29609	He	1058	" It came again some one moving softly , furtively , overhead . Armstrong whispered : "
29626	29631	29620	29621	Mrs. Rogers	94	" Blore whispered back : "
29655	29695	29652	29652	you	1063	" They crept stealthily upstairs . On the little landing outside the door of the bedroom they paused again . Yes , some one was in the room . There was a faint creak from within . Blore whispered : "
29698	29741	29652	29652	you	1063	" He flung open the door and rushed in , the other two close behind him . Then all three stopped dead . Rogers was in the room , his hands full of garments . Blore recovered himself first . He said : "
29757	29764	29747	29751	some one moving about in	1064	" He stopped . Rogers said : "
29804	29817	29787	29787	I	0	" It was to Armstrong that he spoke , and Armstrong replied : "
29829	29845	29847	29847	you	1936	" He avoided looking at the sheeted figure lying on the bed . Rogers said : "
29851	29910	29847	29847	you	1936	" He went out of the room with his arm full of belongings and went down the stairs to the floor below . Armstrong moved over to the bed and , lifting the sheet , looked down on the peaceful face of the dead woman . There was no fear there now . Just emptiness . Armstrong said : "
29929	29938	29919	29919	I	0	" Then he turned to the other two . "
29958	29973	29974	29975	That chap	1072	" Blore was wrestling with the bolts of a low manhole . He said : "
30000	30004	29996	29996	him	1072	" Lombard said : "
30022	30088	30015	30016	a stranger	1075	" Blore disappeared into a cavernous darkness . Lombard pulled a torch from his pocket and followed . Five minutes later three men stood on an upper landing and looked at each other . They were dirty and festooned with cobwebs and their faces were grim . There was no one on the island but their eight selves . Chapter 9 . Lombard said slowly : "
30115	30120	30137	30138	a doctor	286	" Armstrong said gravely : "
30154	30159	30150	30152	a suicidal type	1078	" Lombard said doubtfully : "
30172	30178	30164	30164	I	0	" Blore snorted , unconvinced . "
30185	30198	30164	30164	I	0	" he grunted . There was a pause , then Blore said : "
30202	30206	30164	30164	I	0	" and stopped . "
30210	30211	30200	30201	the woman	464	" "
30230	30235	30164	30164	I	0	" Philip Lombard said : "
30243	30268	30164	30164	I	0	" Blore looked slightly embarrassed . His redbrick face grew a little deeper in hue . He said , almost blurting out the words : "
30284	30290	30274	30274	you	737	" Armstrong stared at him . "
30298	30299	30295	30295	you	737	" "
30316	30317	30303	30303	You	737	" "
30328	30329	30303	30303	You	737	" "
30335	30336	30337	30337	I	0	" "
30351	30360	30337	30337	I	0	" Blore grew redder still . He said : "
30378	30384	30376	30376	you	737	" Dr. Armstrong said angrily : "
30393	30397	30390	30390	you	737	" Blore said : "
30422	30427	30428	30428	I	0	" Armstrong said sharply : "
30440	30451	30454	30454	you	737	" He stopped and added in a cold biting tone : "
30465	30471	30454	30454	you	737	" Philip Lombard said quickly : "
30493	30498	30499	30499	I	0	" Blore said sullenly : "
30509	30529	30530	30530	Doctors	1083	" Dr. Armstrong smiled with an effort . He said , showing his teeth in a somewhat mirthless smile : "
30544	30549	30530	30530	Doctors	1083	" Blore said deliberately : "
30568	30582	30530	30530	Doctors	1083	" Armstrong went white . Philip Lombard said quickly and angrily to Blore : "
30617	30635	30609	30609	your	737	" Blore took a step forward , his hands clenched . He said in a thick voice : "
30673	30679	30671	30671	you	97	" Lombard 's eyebrows rose . "
30683	30684	30671	30671	you	97	" "
30704	30708	30709	30709	You	97	" Lombard said : "
30715	30716	30713	30713	you	97	" "
30725	30730	30722	30723	Mr. Lombard	97	" Lombard said unexpectedly : "
30747	30748	30736	30736	you	737	" "
30760	30764	30765	30765	I	0	" Lombard smiled . "
30779	30784	30765	30765	I	0	" Blore said suspiciously : "
30794	30800	30785	30785	You	97	" Lombard shook his head . "
30808	30812	30801	30801	You	97	" Blore persisted . "
30819	30823	30801	30801	You	97	" said Lombard . "
30833	30838	30839	30839	I	0	" Lombard said slowly : "
30914	30915	30906	30908	a good man	278	" "
30918	30929	30906	30908	a good man	278	" Blore prompted impatiently . Lombard said with a grin : "
30934	30939	30906	30908	a good man	278	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
30949	30950	30942	30942	he	1090	" "
30987	30995	30983	30983	I	0	" Blore looked unconvinced . He said : "
31007	31008	30999	30999	you	97	" "
31012	31018	30999	30999	you	97	" Lombard shrugged eloquent shoulders . "
31048	31054	31039	31039	I	0	" Dr. Armstrong said shrewdly : "
31061	31075	31057	31057	you	97	" Lombard 's face changed . It darkened and hardened . He said : "
31119	31124	31099	31100	Mr. Owen	56	" He said slowly : "
31178	31220	31176	31176	himself	56	" Downstairs the gong pealed a solemn call to lunch . Rogers was standing by the diningroom door . As the three men descended the stairs he moved a step or two forward . He said in a low anxious voice : "
31254	31258	31171	31172	the devil	2006	" Lombard said : "
31270	31271	31278	31278	sir	1891	" "
31319	31335	31296	31296	I	0	" Lombard nodded . Rogers murmured as he followed the three men into the diningroom : "
31358	31359	31354	31354	you	0	" "
31362	31366	31354	31354	you	0	" said Lombard , "
31374	31409	31354	31354	you	0	" Miss Brent came into the room . She had just dropped a ball of wool and was carefully rewinding the end of it . As she took her seat at table she remarked : "
31429	31464	31465	31465	You	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave came in . He walked with a slow measured tread . He darted quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of the diningroom . He said : "
31472	31500	31503	31503	you	0	" There was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice . Vera Claythorne hurried in . She was a little out of breath . She said quickly : "
31514	31519	31520	31520	You	0	" Emily Brent said : "
31533	31545	31526	31527	The General	2050	" They sat round the table . Rogers addressed Miss Brent : "
31557	31561	31554	31554	you	0	" Vera said : "
31584	31587	31588	31588	he	2050	" she hesitated "
31598	31603	31588	31588	he	2050	" Rogers said quickly : "
31615	31621	31604	31604	I	0	" Dr. Armstrong jumped up . "
31626	31630	31622	31622	I	0	" he said . "
31636	31650	31631	31631	You	1111	" He left the room . Behind him he heard Rogers ' voice . "
31662	31694	31660	31660	Madam	2008	" The five people sitting round the table seemed to find conversation difficult . Outside sudden gusts of wind came up and died away . Vera shivered a little and said : "
31701	31714	31727	31727	He	1115	" Blore made a contribution to the discourse . He said conversationally : "
31745	31777	31727	31727	He	1115	" Rogers went round the table collecting the meat plates . Suddenly , with the plates held in his hands , he stopped . He said in an odd scared voice : "
31783	31837	31838	31839	General Macarthur	80	" They could all hear it running feet along the terrace . In that minute , they knew knew without being told ... As by common accord , they all rose to their feet . They stood looking towards the door . Dr. Armstrong appeared , his breath coming fast . He said : "
31840	31841	31838	31839	General Macarthur	80	" "
31844	31855	31858	31858	he	80	" The voice burst from Vera explosively . Armstrong said : "
31862	32004	32007	32007	Miss	1949	" There was a pause a long pause . Seven people looked at each other and could find no words to say . The storm broke just as the old man 's body was borne in through the door . The others were standing in the hall . There was a sudden hiss and roar as the rain came down . As Blore and Armstrong passed up the stairs with their burden , Vera Claythorne turned suddenly and went into the deserted diningroom . It was as they had left it . The sweet course stood ready on the sideboard untasted , Vera went up to the table . She was there a minute or two later when Rogers came softly into the room . He started when he saw her . Then his eyes asked a question . He said : "
32015	32027	32009	32009	I	0	" In a loud harsh voice that surprised herself Vera said : "
32044	32158	32161	32161	doctor	737	" General Macarthur had been laid on his bed . After making a last examination Armstrong left the room and came downstairs . He found the others assembled in the drawingroom . Miss Brent was knitting . Vera Claythorne was standing by the window looking out at the hissing rain , Blore was sitting squarely in a chair , his hands on his knees . Lombard was walking restlessly up and down . At the far end of the room Mr. Justice Wargrave was sitting in a grandfather chair . His eyes were half closed . They opened as the doctor came into the room . He said in a clear penetrating voice : "
32163	32172	32161	32161	doctor	737	" Armstrong was very pale . He said : "
32201	32220	32183	32183	Macarthur	80	" A little murmur went round , but the clear voice of the judge was raised once more . "
32229	32230	32222	32222	you	737	" "
32233	32234	32222	32222	you	737	" "
32243	32244	32236	32236	you	737	" "
32250	32257	32236	32236	you	737	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said quietly : "
32266	32329	32236	32236	you	737	" There was no doubt now who was in charge of the situation . This morning Wargrave had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refraining from any overt activity . Now he assumed command with the ease born of a long habit of authority . He definitely presided over the court . Clearing his throat , he once more spoke . "
32370	32371	32360	32360	You	1936	" "
32377	32387	32360	32360	You	1936	" said Philip Lombard . The judge went on . "
32441	32446	32432	32433	Mr. Owen	56	" Blore said hoarsely : "
32455	32460	32452	32453	A loony	1131	" The judge coughed . "
32482	32490	32493	32494	no one	2220	" Armstrong said in a trembling voice : "
32506	32517	32499	32499	I	0	" The judge stroked his jaw . He said gently : "
32632	32645	32620	32621	Mr. Owen	56	" It is perfectly clear . Mr. Owen is one of us ... "
32646	32655	32658	32658	Vera	125	" Oh , no , no , no ... "
32679	32776	32676	32676	He	338	" My dear young lady , this is no time for refusing to look facts in the face . We are all in grave danger . One of us is U.N. Owen . And we do not know which of us . Of the ten people who came to this island three are definitely cleared . Anthony Marston , Mrs. Rogers , and General Macarthur have gone beyond suspicion . There are seven of us left . Of those seven , one is , if I may so express myself , a bogus little Indian boy . "
32783	32793	32777	32777	He	1139	" Do I take it that you all agree ? "
32797	32808	32794	32794	Armstrong	86	" It 's fantastic but I suppose you 're right . "
32812	32831	32809	32809	Blore	93	" Not a doubt of it . And if you ask me , I 've a very good idea "
32849	32875	32844	32845	The judge	338	" We will come to that presently . At the moment all I wish to establish is that we are in agreement on the facts . "
32884	32902	32876	32877	Emily Brent	76	" Your argument seems logical . I agree that one of us is possessed by a devil . "
32906	32917	32903	32903	Vera	125	" I ca n't believe it ... I ca n't ... "
32921	32924	32918	32918	Wargrave	55	" Lombard ? "
32925	32933	32934	32935	The judge	338	" I agree , sir , absolutely . "
32947	32982	32944	32944	He	338	" Now let us examine the evidence . To begin with , is there any reason for suspecting one particular person ? Mr. Blore , you have , I think , something to say . "
32991	33011	32988	32988	He	93	" Lombard 's got a revolver . He did n't tell the truth last night . He admits it . "
33020	33029	33017	33017	He	71	" I suppose I 'd better explain again . "
33045	33060	33041	33041	Blore	93	" What 's to prove it ? There 's nothing to corroborate your story . "
33065	33068	33069	33069	he	338	" Unfortunately , "
33072	33090	33091	33091	He	338	" we are all in that position . There is only our own word to go upon . "
33095	33144	33091	33091	He	338	" You have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is . To my mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt . Is there any one whom we can definitely eliminate from suspicion on the evidence which is in our possession ? "
33150	33167	33145	33146	Dr. Armstrong	86	" I am a wellknown professional man . The mere idea that I can be suspected of "
33195	33231	33232	33232	he	55	" I , too , am a wellknown person ! But , my dear sir , that proves less than nothing ! Doctors have gone mad before now . Judges have gone mad . So , "
33239	33243	33232	33232	he	55	" have policemen ! "
33247	33263	33244	33244	Lombard	71	" At any rate , I suppose you 'll leave the women out of it . "
33275	33277	33270	33270	He	338	" acid "
33285	33301	33270	33270	He	338	" Do I understand you to assert that women are not subject to homicidal mania ? "
33306	33320	33321	33321	He	338	" Of course not . But all the same , it hardly seems possible "
33337	33362	33363	33364	The doctor	287	" I take it , Dr. Armstrong , that a woman would have been physically capable of striking the blow that killed poor Macarthur ? "
33368	33384	33363	33364	The doctor	287	" Perfectly capable given a suitable instrument , such as a rubber truncheon or cosh . "
33385	33395	33363	33364	The doctor	287	" It would require no undue exertion of force ? "
33396	33401	33402	33404	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Not at all . "
33413	33445	33410	33410	He	55	" The other two deaths have resulted from the administration of drugs . That , no one will dispute , is easily compassed by a person of the smallest physical strength . "
33450	33457	33446	33446	Vera	125	" I think you 're mad ! "
33488	33501	33485	33485	She	125	" He 's just seeing me as a as a specimen . And "
33510	33518	33522	33523	the judge	338	" he does n't like me much ! "
33527	33546	33522	33523	the judge	338	" My dear young lady , do try and restrain your feelings . I am not accusing you . "
33553	33577	33547	33547	He	338	" I hope , Miss Brent , that you are not offended by my insistence that all of us are equally under suspicion ? "
33596	33680	33593	33593	she	76	" The idea that I should be accused of taking a fellow creature 's life not to speak of the lives of three fellow creatures is , of course , quite absurd to any one who knows anything of my character . But I quite appreciate the fact that we are all strangers to one another and that in those circumstances , nobody can be exonerated without the fullest proof . There is , as I have said , a devil amongst us . "
33685	33705	33681	33682	The judge	338	" Then we are agreed . There can be no elimination on the ground of character or position alone . "
33709	33714	33706	33706	Lombard	71	" What about Rogers ? "
33722	33727	33728	33728	Lombard	71	" What about him ? "
33731	33745	33728	33728	Lombard	71	" Well , to my mind , Rogers seems pretty well ruled out . "
33751	33759	33760	33760	Lombard	71	" Indeed , and on what grounds ? "
33763	33785	33760	33760	Lombard	71	" He has n't got the brains for one thing . And for another his wife was one of the victims . "
33798	33825	33795	33795	He	338	" In my time , young man , several people have come before me accused of the murders of their wives and have been found guilty . "
33826	33928	33929	33931	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Oh ! I agree . Wife murder is perfectly possible almost natural , let 's say ! But not this particular kind ! I can believe in Rogers killing his wife because he was scared of her breaking down and giving him away , or because he 'd taken a dislike to her , or because he wanted to link up with some nice little bit rather less long in the tooth . But I ca n't see him as the lunatic Mr. Owen dealing out crazy justice and starting on his own wife for a crime they both committed . "
33934	34003	34004	34004	Lombard	71	" You are assuming hearsay to be evidence . We do not know that Rogers and his wife conspired to murder their employer . That may have been a false statement , made so that Rogers should appear to be in the same position as ourselves . Mrs. Rogers ' terror last night may have been due to the fact that she realized her husband was mentally unhinged . "
34007	34031	34004	34004	Lombard	71	" Well , have it your own way , U.N. Owen is one of us . No exceptions allowed . We all qualify . "
34037	34126	34032	34034	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" My point is that there can be no exceptions allowed on the score of character , position , or probability . What we must now examine is the possibility of eliminating one or more persons on the facts . To put it simply , is there among us one or more persons who could not possibly have administered either Cyanide to Anthony Marston , or an overdose of sleeping draught to Mrs. Rogers , and who had no opportunity of striking the blow that killed General Macarthur ? "
34139	34147	34148	34148	he	93	" Now you 're talking , sir ! "
34151	34243	34148	34148	he	93	" That 's the stuff ! Let 's go into it . As regards young Marston I do n't think there 's anything to be done . It 's already been suggested that some one from outside slipped something into the dregs of his glass before he refilled it for the last time . A person actually in the room could have done that even more easily . I ca n't remember if Rogers was in the room , but any of the rest of us could certainly have done it . "
34251	34282	34244	34244	He	93	" Now take the woman Rogers . The people who stand out there are her husband and the doctor . Either of them could have done it as easy as winking "
34293	34313	34289	34289	He	86	" I protest This is absolutely uncalled for ! I swear that the dose I gave the woman was perfectly "
34314	34318	34244	34244	He	93	" Dr. Armstrong . "
34346	34428	34429	34429	He	287	" Your indignation is very natural . Nevertheless you must admit that the facts have got to be faced . Either you or Rogers could have administered a fatal dose with the greatest ease . Let us now consider the position of the other people present . What chance had I , had Inspector Blore , had Miss Brent , had Miss Claythorne , had Mr. Lombard of administering poison ? Can any one of us be completely and entirely eliminated ? "
34432	34437	34438	34438	Vera	125	" I think not . "
34442	34458	34438	34438	Vera	125	" I was nowhere near the woman ! All of you can swear to that . "
34470	34563	34467	34467	he	55	" As far as my memory serves me the facts were these will any one please correct me if I make a misstatement ? Mrs. Rogers was lifted onto the sofa by Anthony Marston and Mr. Lombard and Dr. Armstrong went to her . He sent Rogers for brandy . There was then a question raised as to where the voice we had just heard had come from . We all went into the next room with the exception of Miss Brent who remained in this room alone with the unconscious woman . "
34582	34587	34579	34579	She	76	" This is outrageous ! "
34595	34617	34618	34619	Emily Brent	76	" When we returned to this room , you , Miss Brent , were bending over the woman on the sofa . "
34622	34630	34618	34619	Emily Brent	76	" Is common humanity a criminal offence ? "
34636	34695	34631	34633	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" I am only establishing facts . Rogers then entered the room with the brandy which , of course , he could quite well have doctored before entering the room . The brandy was administered to the woman and shortly afterwards her husband and Dr. Armstrong assisted her up to bed where Dr. Armstrong gave her a sedative . "
34699	34722	34696	34696	Blore	157	" That 's what happened . Absolutely . And that lets out the judge , Mr. Lombard , myself and Miss Claythorne . "
34745	34761	34730	34732	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Ah , but does it ? We must take into account every possible eventuality . "
34768	34775	34765	34765	He	157	" I do n't get you . "
34781	34879	34776	34778	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Upstairs in her room , Mrs. Rogers is lying in bed . The sedative that the doctor has given her begins to take effect . She is vaguely sleepy and acquiescent . Supposing that at that moment there is a tap on the door and some one enters bringing her , shall we say , a tablet , or a draught , with the message that ' the doctor says you 're to take this . ' Do you imagine for one minute that she would not have swallowed it obediently without thinking twice about it ? "
34896	34931	34892	34893	Philip Lombard	71	" I do n't believe in that story for a minute . Besides none of us left this room for hours afterwards . There was Marston 's death and all the rest of it . "
34936	34948	34949	34949	Lombard	71	" Some one could have left his or her bedroom later . "
34952	34962	34949	34949	Lombard	71	" But then Rogers would have been up there . "
34967	34970	34971	34971	he	86	" No , "
34974	35003	34971	34971	he	86	" Rogers went downstairs to clear up in the diningroom and pantry . Any one could have gone up to the woman 's bedroom then without being seen . "
35008	35032	35004	35005	Emily Brent	76	" Surely , doctor , the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the influence of the drug you had administered ? "
35033	35095	35096	35096	Lombard	71	" In all likelihood , yes . But it is not a certainty . Until you have prescribed for a patient more than once you can not tell their reaction to different drugs . There is , sometimes , a considerable period before a sedative takes effect . It depends on the personal idiosyncrasy of the patient towards that particular drug . "
35099	35114	35096	35096	Lombard	71	" Of course you would say that , doctor . Suits your book eh ? "
35137	35273	35274	35274	Blore	93	" No good result can come from recrimination . Facts are what we have to deal with . It is established , I think , that there is a possibility of such a thing as I have outlined occurring . I agree that its probability value is not high ; though there again , it depends on who that person might have been . The appearance of Miss Brent or of Miss Claythorne on such an errand would have occasioned no surprise in the patient 's mind . I agree that the appearance of myself , or of Mr. Blore , or of Mr. Lombard could have been , to say the least of it , unusual , but I still think the visit would have been received without the awakening of any real suspicion . "
35277	35284	35274	35274	Blore	93	" And that gets us where ? "
35301	35328	35285	35287	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" We have now dealt with the second killing , and have established the fact that no one of us can be completely exonerated from suspicion . "
35335	35408	35329	35329	He	55	" We come now to the death of General Macarthur . That took place this morning . I will ask any one who considers that he or she has an alibi to state it in so many words . I myself will state at once that I have no valid alibi . I spent the morning sitting on the terrace and meditating on the singular position in which we all find ourselves . "
35499	35503	35504	35504	I	0	" Blore said : "
35522	35527	35516	35516	They	1158	" Dr. Armstrong said : "
35537	35541	35528	35528	You	0	" Blore said : "
35560	35564	35557	35557	I	0	" Armstrong said : "
35571	35579	35584	35584	you	0	" Blore turned crimson . He said : "
35592	35596	35584	35584	you	0	" Armstrong repeated : "
35606	35607	35597	35597	I	0	" "
35632	35638	35620	35620	your	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave said : "
35651	35656	35646	35646	you	1160	" Armstrong said hotly : "
35676	35683	35670	35670	I	0	" Lombard said with a smile : "
35712	35719	35703	35703	I	0	" Armstrong nodded . He said : "
35736	35741	35732	35732	I	0	" The judge said : "
35752	35753	35732	35732	I	0	" "
35758	35763	35732	35732	I	0	" Philip Lombard said : "
35770	35776	35764	35764	I	0	" The judge said evenly : "
35786	35803	35804	35805	Miss Brent	76	" He turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her lap . "
35807	35812	35804	35805	Miss Brent	76	" Emily Brent said : "
35838	35843	35829	35829	I	0	" The judge said : "
35853	35854	35850	35850	you	0	" "
35877	35878	35857	35857	I	0	" "
35887	35888	35880	35880	you	0	" "
35891	35892	35880	35880	you	0	" "
35896	35903	35893	35894	Miss Claythorne	125	" Vera answered readily and clearly . "
35931	35940	35922	35922	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave interrupted . He said : "
35946	35958	35959	35959	I	0	" Vera for the first time was vague . She said ; "
35979	35983	35970	35970	I	0	" Blore asked : "
35995	35999	36000	36000	I	0	" Vera said : "
36011	36015	36006	36006	he	80	" She shivered . "
36023	36037	36038	36038	He	80	" the judge wanted to know . Vera said in a low voice : "
36060	36068	36056	36056	he	80	" The judge nodded . He said : "
36075	36076	36071	36071	you	0	" "
36108	36119	36100	36100	I	0	" Mr. Justice Wargrave stroked his chin . He said : "
36139	36269	36125	36125	I	0	" Rogers , summoned before the court , had very little to tell . He had been busy all the morning about household duties and with the preparation of lunch . He had taken cocktails onto the terrace before lunch and had then gone up to remove his things from the attic to another room . He had not looked out of the window during the morning and had seen nothing that could have any bearing upon the death of General Macarthur . He would swear definitely that there had been eight china figures upon the diningtable when he laid the table for lunch . At the conclusion of Rogers ' evidence there was a pause . Mr. Justice Wargrave cleared his throat . Lombard murmured to Vera Claythorne : "
36278	36283	36125	36125	I	0	" The judge said : "
36423	36510	36511	36512	Philip Lombard	71	" I would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any suggestions that may occur to you . In the meantime I warn everybody to be upon his or her guard . So far the murderer has had an easy task , since his victims have been unsuspicious . From now on , it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst us . Forewarned is forearmed . Take no risks and be alert to danger . That is all . "
36518	36525	36511	36512	Philip Lombard	71	" The court will now adjourn ... "
36529	36535	36536	36536	Vera	125	" Do you believe it ? "
36584	36605	36581	36581	he	71	" You mean , do I believe that old Wargrave is right when he says it 's one of us ? "
36606	36609	36610	36611	Philip Lombard	71	" Yes . "
36615	36633	36610	36611	Philip Lombard	71	" It 's difficult to say . Logically , you know , he 's right , and yet "
36643	36651	36634	36634	Vera	125	" And yet it seems so incredible ! "
36658	36701	36652	36653	Philip Lombard	71	" The whole thing 's incredible ! But after Macarthur 's death there 's no more doubt as to one thing . There 's no question now of accidents or suicides . It 's definitely murder . Three murders up to date . "
36708	36727	36705	36705	She	125	" It 's like some awful dream . I keep feeling that things like this ca n't happen ! "
36733	36755	36728	36728	He	71	" I know . Presently a tap will come on the door , and early morning tea will be brought in . "
36759	36769	36756	36756	Vera	125	" Oh , how I wish that could happen ! "
36775	36805	36770	36771	Philip Lombard	71	" Yes , but it wo n't ! We 're all in the dream ! And we 've got to be pretty much upon our guard from now on . "
36813	36828	36810	36810	her	125	" If if it is one of them which do you think it is ? "
36837	36908	36834	36834	He	71	" I take it you are excepting our two selves ? Well , that 's all right . I know very well that I 'm not the murderer , and I do n't fancy that there 's anything insane about you , Vera . You strike me as being one of the sanest and most levelheaded girls I 've come across . I 'd stake my reputation on your sanity . "
36918	36922	36915	36915	Vera	125	" Thank you . "
36926	36943	36923	36923	He	71	" Come now , Miss Vera Claythorne , are n't you going to return the compliment ? "
36953	36990	36950	36950	she	125	" You 've admitted , you know , that you do n't hold human life particularly sacred , but all the same I ca n't see you as as the man who dictated that gramophone record . "
36994	37072	36991	36991	Lombard	71	" Quite right . If I were to commit one or more murders it would be solely for what I could get out of them . This mass clearance is n't my line of country . Good , then we 'll eliminate ourselves and concentrate on our five fellow prisoners . Which of them is U.N. Owen ? Well , at a guess , and with absolutely nothing to go upon , I 'd plump for Wargrave ! "
37073	37076	37077	37077	Vera	125	" Oh ! "
37091	37094	37081	37081	She	125	" Why ? "
37095	37193	37194	37194	Vera	125	" Hard to say exactly . But to begin with , he 's an old man and he 's been presiding over courts of law for years . That is to say , he 's played God Almighty for a good many months every year . That must go to a man 's head eventually . He gets to see himself as all powerful , as holding the power of life and death and it 's possible that his brain might snap and he might want to go one step farther and be Executioner and Judge Extraordinary . "
37198	37207	37194	37194	Vera	125	" Yes , I suppose that 's possible ... "
37211	37218	37208	37208	Lombard	71	" Who do you plump for ? "
37225	37229	37222	37222	Vera	125	" Dr. Armstrong . "
37236	37254	37230	37230	Lombard	71	" The doctor , eh ? You know , I should have put him last of all . "
37260	37309	37310	37310	Lombard	71	" Oh , no ! Two of the deaths have been poison . That rather points to a doctor . And then you ca n't get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain Mrs. Rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave her . "
37313	37320	37310	37310	Lombard	71	" Yes , that 's true . "
37324	37352	37321	37321	Vera	125	" If a doctor went mad , it would be a long time before any one suspected . And doctors overwork and have a lot of strain . "
37357	37418	37353	37354	Philip Lombard	71	" Yes but I doubt if he could have killed Macarthur . He would n't have had time during that brief interval when I left him not , that is , unless he fairly hared down there and back again , and I doubt if he 's in good enough training to do that and show no signs of it . "
37422	37436	37419	37419	Vera	125	" He did n't do it then . He had an opportunity later . "
37437	37440	37454	37454	Philip	71	" When ? "
37441	37453	37454	37454	Philip	71	" When he went down to call the General to lunch . "
37463	37478	37479	37479	Vera	125	" So you think he did it then ? Pretty cool thing to do . "
37483	37518	37479	37479	Vera	125	" What risk was there ? He 's the only person here with medical knowledge . He can swear the body 's been dead at least an hour and who 's to contradict him ? "
37525	37529	37530	37530	he	71	" You know , "
37533	37544	37530	37530	he	71	" that 's a clever idea of yours . I wonder "
37545	37565	37566	37566	Rogers	94	" Who is it , Mr. Blore ? That 's what I want to know . Who is it ? "
37593	37604	37587	37590	Ex - Inspector Blore	157	" Eh , my lad , that 's the question ! "
37605	37635	37566	37566	Rogers	94	" One of us , ' is lordship said . Which one ? That 's what I want to know . Who 's the fiend in ' uman form ? "
37636	37639	37641	37641	Blore	93	" That , "
37643	37653	37654	37654	Rogers	94	" is what we all would like to know . "
37658	37679	37654	37654	Rogers	94	" But you 've got an idea , Mr. Blore . You 've got an idea , ' aven't you ? "
37680	37687	37689	37689	Blore	93	" I may have an idea , "
37692	37733	37734	37734	Rogers	94	" But that 's a long way from being sure . I may be wrong . All I can say is that if I 'm right the person in question is a very cool customer a very cool customer indeed . "
37746	37760	37761	37761	Blore	93	" It 's like a bad dream , that 's what it is . "
37769	37777	37761	37761	Blore	93	" Got any ideas yourself , Rogers ? "
37788	37818	37784	37784	He	459	" I do n't know . I do n't know at all . And that 's what 's frightening the life out of me . To have no idea ... "
37824	37840	37819	37820	Dr. Armstrong	86	" We must get out of here we must we must ! At all costs ! "
37864	37913	37861	37861	He	55	" I do not , of course , profess to be a weather prophet . But I should say that it is very unlikely that a boat could reach us even if they knew of our plight under twentyfour hours and even then only if the wind drops . "
37928	37942	37925	37925	He	86	" And in the meantime we may all be murdered in our beds ? "
37943	37948	37950	37952	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" I hope not , "
37954	37968	37950	37952	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" I intend to take every possible precaution against such a thing happening . "
38038	38060	38032	38034	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Murdered in our beds ! These doctors are all the same they think in cliches . A thoroughly commonplace mind . "
38065	38075	38061	38062	The doctor	287	" There have been three victims already , remember . "
38076	38095	38096	38097	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Certainly . But you must remember that they were unprepared for the attack . We are forewarned . "
38101	38110	38096	38097	Dr. Armstrong	86	" What can we do ? Sooner or later "
38111	38115	38117	38119	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" I think , "
38121	38131	38132	38132	Armstrong	86	" that there are several things we can do . "
38135	38147	38132	38132	Armstrong	86	" We 've no idea , even , who it can be "
38156	38169	38148	38149	The judge	338	" Oh , you know , I would n't quite say that . "
38175	38182	38170	38170	Armstrong	86	" Do you mean you know ? "
38189	38235	38183	38185	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" As regards actual evidence , such as is necessary in court , I admit that I have none . But it appears to me , reviewing the whole business , that one particular person is sufficiently clearly indicated . Yes , I think so . "
38244	38250	38241	38241	He	338	" I do n't understand . "
38315	38402	38308	38308	She	76	" A terrible thing has happened . General Macarthur is dead . ( His cousin married Elsie MacPherson . ) There is no doubt but that he was murdered . After luncheon the judge made us a most interesting speech . He is convinced that the murderer is one of us . That means that one of us is possessed by a devil . I had already suspected that . Which of us is it ? They are all asking themselves that . I alone know ... "
38485	38500	38478	38478	She	76	" Did I write that ? Did I ? I must be going mad ... "
38551	38566	38548	38548	He	1195	" Shall I draw the curtains ? It would make it more cheerful like . "
38620	38630	38616	38617	Vera Claythorne	125	" Will you pour out tea , Miss Brent ? "
38636	38665	38631	38633	The elder woman	1199	" No , you do it , dear . That teapot is so heavy . And I have lost two skeins of my grey knittingwool . So annoying . "
38741	38760	38734	38734	He	1195	" Excuse me , sir , but does any one know what 's become of the bathroom curtain ? "
38770	38784	38761	38761	Lombard	71	" The bathroom curtain ? What the devil do you mean , Rogers ? "
38785	38816	38817	38819	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" It 's gone , sir , clean vanished . I was going round drawing all the curtains and the one in the lav bathroom was n't there any longer . "
38822	38829	38817	38819	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Was it there this morning ? "
38830	38837	38838	38838	Blore	93	" Oh , yes , sir . "
38841	38850	38838	38838	Blore	93	" What kind of a curtain was it ? "
38851	38864	38865	38865	Lombard	71	" Scarlet oilsilk , sir . It went with the scarlet tiles . "
38868	38874	38865	38865	Lombard	71	" And it 's gone ? "
38875	38880	38881	38881	They	1200	" Gone , sir . "
38891	38929	38887	38887	Blore	93	" Well after all what of it ? It 's mad but so 's everything else . Anyway , it does n't matter . You ca n't kill anybody with an oilsilk curtain . Forget about it . "
38933	38943	38944	38944	He	1202	" Yes , sir , thank you , sir . "
39024	39031	39021	39021	She	76	" I 'm going to bed . "
39035	39043	39032	39032	Vera	125	" I 'll go to bed too . "
39105	39116	39099	39099	Blore	93	" No need to tell 'em to lock their doors ! "
39120	39135	39117	39117	Lombard	71	" Well , they 're all right for the night , at any rate ! "
39196	39210	39190	39191	the judge	338	" I need hardly advise you , gentlemen , to lock your doors . "
39214	39238	39211	39211	Blore	93	" And , what 's more , put a chair under the handle . There are ways of turning locks from the outside . "
39242	39257	39239	39239	Lombard	71	" My dear Blore , the trouble with you is you know too much ! "
39263	39277	39258	39259	The judge	338	" Goodnight , gentlemen . May we all meet safely in the morning ! "
39318	39324	39325	39325	he	71	" That 's all right , "
39370	39384	39367	39367	He	71	" I 'll see no one plays tricks tonight , at any rate . "
39476	39488	39471	39471	He	71	" No more Indian tricks tonight I 've seen to that ... "
39605	39618	39600	39600	He	71	" I think the time has come to do something about this . "
39660	39676	39655	39656	Philip Lombard	71	" Sleeping the clock round ? Well , shows you 've got an easy conscience . "
39681	39687	39677	39677	Blore	93	" What 's the matter ? "
39691	39709	39688	39688	Lombard	71	" Anybody called you or brought you any tea ? Do you know what time it is ? "
39727	39747	39724	39724	He	93	" Twentyfive to ten . Would n't have believed I could have slept like that . Where 's Rogers ? "
39752	39762	39748	39749	Philip Lombard	71	" It 's a case of echo answers where ? "
39763	39768	39774	39774	Lombard	71	" What d'you mean ? "
39777	39810	39774	39774	Lombard	71	" I mean that Rogers is missing . He is n't in his room or anywhere else . And there 's no kettle on and the kitchen fire is n't even lit . "
39820	39849	39817	39817	He	93	" Where the devil can he be ? Out on the island somewhere ? Wait till I get some clothes on . See if the others know anything . "
39939	39946	39936	39936	Lombard	71	" He got up all right . "
39962	39975	39947	39947	Vera	125	" You do n't think he 's hiding somewhere waiting for us ? "
39979	40006	39976	39976	Lombard	71	" My dear girl , I 'm prepared to think anything of any one ! My advice is that we keep together until we find him . "
40010	40020	40007	40007	Armstrong	86	" He must be out on the island somewhere . "
40035	40047	40021	40021	Blore	93	" Where 's Miss Brent got to that 's another mystery ? "
40074	40094	40071	40071	She	76	" The sea is as high as ever . I should n't think any boat could put out today . "
40098	40125	40095	40095	Blore	93	" Have you been wandering about the island alone , Miss Brent ? Do n't you realize that that 's an exceedingly foolish thing to do ? "
40130	40146	40147	40147	Blore	93	" I assure you , Mr. Blore , that I kept an extremely sharp lookout . "
40153	40159	40150	40150	He	93	" Seen anything of Rogers ? "
40166	40181	40160	40161	Miss Brent	76	" Rogers ? No , I have n't seen him this morning . Why ? "
40213	40224	40210	40210	He	55	" He laid the table for breakfast , I see . "
40228	40237	40225	40225	Lombard	71	" He might have done that last night . "
40305	40311	40301	40301	She	125	" The Indians ! Look ! "
40402	40406	40408	40408	Armstrong	86	" Perfectly clear , "
40410	40437	40408	40408	Armstrong	86	" The murderer must have crept up behind him , swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending over . "
40460	40470	40471	40471	Armstrong	86	" Would it have needed great force , doctor ? "
40475	40489	40471	40471	Armstrong	86	" A woman could have done it if that 's what you mean . "
40508	40562	40563	40564	The judge	338	" The girl could have done it easily she 's an athletic type . In appearance Miss Brent is fragile looking , but that type of woman has often a lot of wiry strength . And you must remember that any one who 's mentally unhinged has a good deal of unsuspected strength . "
40580	40589	40577	40577	He	93	" No fingerprints . Handle was wiped afterwards . "
40624	40648	40608	40608	She	125	" Do they keep bees on this island ? Tell me that . Where do we go for honey ? Ha ! ha ! "
40679	40811	40670	40670	She	125	" Do n't stare like that ! As though you thought I was mad . It 's sane enough what I 'm asking . Bees , hives , bees ! Oh , do n't you understand ? Have n't you read that idiotic rhyme ? It 's up in all your bedrooms put there for you to study ! We might have come here straightaway if we 'd had sense . Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks . And the next verse . I know the whole thing by heart , I tell you ! Six little Indian boys playing with a hive . And that 's why I 'm asking do they keep bees on this island ? is n't it funny ? is n't it damned funny ... ? "
40854	40864	40851	40851	she	125	" Thank you ... I 'm all right now . "
40893	40913	40881	40881	She	125	" Miss Brent and I are getting you breakfast . Can you bring some sticks to light the fire ? "
40937	40949	40934	40934	Blore	93	" Well , you dealt with that all right , doctor . "
40954	40971	40950	40950	Armstrong	86	" Had to ! We ca n't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else . "
40976	40984	40972	40973	Philip Lombard	71	" She 's not a hysterical type . "
40988	41009	40985	40985	Armstrong	86	" Oh , no . Good healthy sensible girl . Just the sudden shock . It might happen to anybody . "
41063	41090	41059	41060	Emily Brent	76	" Thank you . We 'll be as quick as we can say half an hour to three quarters . The kettle 's got to boil . "
41105	41112	41091	41094	Ex - Inspector Blore	157	" Know what I 'm thinking ? "
41117	41136	41113	41114	Philip Lombard	71	" As you 're just about to tell me , it 's not worth the trouble of guessing . "
41159	41231	41232	41232	He	157	" There was a case in America . Old gentleman and his wife both killed with an axe . Middle of the morning . Nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid . Maid , it was proved , could n't have done it . Daughter was a respectable middleaged spinster . Seemed incredible . So incredible that they acquitted her . But they never found any other explanation . "
41235	41293	41154	41154	He	157	" I thought of that when I saw the axe and then when I went into the kitchen and saw her there so neat and calm . Had n't turned a hair ! That girl , coming all over hysterical well , that 's natural the sort of thing you 'd expect do n't you think so ? "
41299	41304	41305	41305	Blore	157	" It might be . "
41309	41420	41305	41305	Blore	157	" But the other ! So neat and prim wrapped up in that apron Mrs. Rogers ' apron , I suppose saying : ' Breakfast will be ready in half an hour or so . ' If you ask me that woman 's as mad as a hatter ! Lots of elderly spinsters go that way I do n't mean go in for homicide on the grand scale , but go queer in their heads . Unfortunately it 's taken her this way . Religious mania thinks she 's God 's instrument , something of that kind ! She sits in her room , you know , reading her Bible . "
41427	41440	41421	41422	Philip Lombard	71	" That 's hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality , Blore . "
41450	41471	41442	41442	Blore	157	" And then she was out in her mackintosh , said she 'd been down to look at the sea . "
41481	41538	41478	41478	He	157	" Rogers was killed as he was chopping firewood that is to say first thing when he got up . The Brent woman would n't have needed to wander about outside for hours afterwards . If you ask me , the murderer of Rogers would take jolly good care to be rolled up in bed snoring . "
41542	41596	41539	41539	Blore	157	" You 're missing the point , Mr. Lombard . If the woman was innocent she 'd be too dead scared to go wandering about by herself . She 'd only do that if she knew that she had nothing to fear . That 's to say if she herself is the criminal . "
41601	41617	41618	41618	He	71	" That 's a good point ... Yes , I had n't thought of that . "
41625	41634	41635	41635	Blore	157	" Glad you do n't still suspect me . "
41640	41675	41676	41676	He	157	" I did start by thinking of you that revolver and the queer story you told or did n't tell . But I 've realized now that that was really a bit too obvious , "
41681	41690	41676	41676	He	157	" Hope you feel the same about me . "
41695	41746	41747	41747	He	71	" I may be wrong , of course , but I ca n't feel that you 've got enough imagination for this job . All I can say is , if you 're the criminal , you 're a damned fine actor and I take my hat off to you . "
41752	41791	41749	41749	his	71	" Just between ourselves , Blore , and taking into account that we 'll probably both be a couple of stiffs before another day is out , you did indulge in that spot of perjury , I suppose ? "
41807	41856	41802	41802	He	157	" Does n't seem to make much odds now . Oh , well , here goes . Landor was innocent right enough . The gang had got me squared and between us we got him put away for a stretch . Mind you , I would n't admit this "
41857	41864	41866	41866	Lombard	71	" If there were any witnesses , "
41871	41893	41866	41866	Lombard	71	" It 's just between you and me . Well , I hope you made a tidy bit out of it . "
41894	41918	41802	41802	He	157	" Did n't make what I should have done . Mean crowd , the Purcell gang . I got my promotion , though . "
41919	41930	41802	41802	He	157	" And Landor got penal servitude and died in prison . "
41931	41945	41947	41947	Blore	157	" I could n't know he was going to die , could I ? "
41949	41958	41947	41947	Blore	157	" No , that was your bad luck . "
41959	41967	41802	41802	He	157	" Mine ? His , you mean . "
41968	41996	41802	41802	He	157	" Yours , too . Because , as a result of it , it looks as though your own life is going to be cut unpleasantly short . "
41997	42000	41947	41947	Blore	157	" Me ? "
42006	42042	42043	42043	Lombard	71	" Do you think I 'm going to go the way of Rogers and the rest of them ? Not me ! I 'm watching out for myself pretty carefully , I can tell you . "
42046	42069	42043	42043	Lombard	71	" Oh , well I 'm not a betting man . And anyway if you were dead I would n't get paid . "
42070	42082	42083	42084	Philip Lombard	71	" Look here , Mr. Lombard , what do you mean ? "
42092	42111	42089	42089	He	71	" I mean , my dear Blore , that in my opinion you have n't got a chance ! "
42112	42115	42179	42179	He	71	" What ? "
42116	42152	42153	42153	Blore	157	" Your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target . A criminal of the imagination of U.N. Owen can make rings round you any time he or she wants to . "
42163	42169	42159	42159	He	157	" And what about you ? "
42182	42227	42179	42179	He	71	" I 've a pretty good imagination of my own . I 've been in tight places before now and got out of them ! I think I wo n't say more than that but I think I 'll get out of this one . "
42245	42270	42235	42235	Vera	125	" Why did I make a hysterical fool of myself ? That was a mistake . Keep calm , my girl , keep calm . "
42283	42299	42274	42274	she	125	" Miss Claythorne was wonderful kept her head started off swimming after Cyril at once . "
42408	42416	42403	42404	Emily Brent	76	" Vera , that bacon is burning . "
42417	42434	42435	42436	Emily Brent	76	" Oh , sorry , Miss Brent , so it is . How stupid of me . "
42461	42470	42447	42447	Vera	125	" You 're wonderfully calm , Miss Brent . "
42480	42496	42471	42472	Emily Brent	76	" I was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fuss . "
42501	42513	42514	42514	She	125	" Repressed as a child ... That accounts for a lot ... "
42517	42523	42514	42514	She	125	" Are n't you afraid ? "
42530	42538	42524	42524	She	125	" Or do n't you mind dying ? "
42653	42662	42646	42646	she	76	" The Lord is mindful of his own . "
42663	42684	42603	42603	her	76	" Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ... "
42694	42838	42603	42603	her	76	" We shall none of us leave this island ... Who had said that ? General Macarthur , of course , whose cousin had married Elsie MacPherson . He had n't seemed to care . He had seemed actually to welcome the idea ! Wicked ! Almost impious to feel that way . Some people thought so little of death that they actually took their own lives . Beatrice Taylor ... Last night she had dreamed of Beatrice dreamt that she was outside pressing her face against the window and moaning , asking to be let in . But Emily Brent had n't wanted to let her in . Because , if she did , something terrible would happen ... Emily came to herself with a start . That girl was looking at her very strangely . She said in a brisk voice : "
42854	42867	42847	42847	We	1269	" Breakfast was a curious meal . Every one was very polite . "
42879	42880	42876	42877	Miss Brent	76	" "
42889	42890	42881	42882	Miss Claythorne	125	" "
42896	42922	42881	42882	Miss Claythorne	125	" Six people , all outwardly selfpossessed and normal . And within ? Thoughts that ran round in a circle like squirrels in a cage ... "
42933	42934	42881	42882	Miss Claythorne	125	" "
42960	42961	42952	42953	My God	2077	" "
42987	42988	42983	42983	I	0	" "

43051	43070	43041	43041	I	0	" Six of those little china figures ... only six how many will there be by tonight ? ... "
43071	43079	43115	43115	his	55	" Who 'll have the last egg ? "
43080	43083	43115	43115	his	55	" Marmalade ? "
43084	43094	43095	43096	Six people	1273	" Thanks , can I give you some ham ? "
43126	43156	43118	43118	He	55	" It would be advisable , I think , if we met to discuss the situation . Shall we say in half an hour 's time in the drawingroom ? "
43176	43185	43173	43173	She	125	" I 'll clear away and wash up . "
43190	43203	43186	43187	Philip Lombard	71	" We 'll bring the stuff out to the pantry for you . "
43204	43207	43208	43209	Emily Brent	76	" Thanks . "
43223	43228	43220	43220	She	76	" Oh , dear . "
43233	43241	43229	43230	The judge	338	" Anything the matter , Miss Brent ? "
43246	43275	43242	43242	Emily	76	" I 'm sorry . I 'd like to help Miss Claythorne , but I do n't know how it is . I feel just a little giddy . "
43276	43281	43282	43283	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Giddy , eh ? "
43288	43301	43282	43283	Dr. Armstrong	86	" Quite natural . Delayed shock . I can give you something to "
43302	43305	43310	43310	her	76	" No ! "
43346	43355	43342	43342	He	86	" Just as you please , Miss Brent . "
43359	43383	43356	43356	She	76	" I do n't wish to take anything anything at all . I will just sit here quietly till the giddiness passes off . "
43395	43414	43392	43392	Blore	157	" I 'm a domestic sort of man . I 'll give you a hand , Miss Claythorne . "
43418	43422	43415	43415	Vera	125	" Thank you . "
43486	43495	43483	43483	She	76	" It 's like a bee a bumblebee . "
43684	43692	43680	43681	Vera Claythorne	125	" Shall I go and fetch her ? "
43697	43702	43693	43693	Blore	157	" Just a minute . "
43718	43761	43715	43715	He	157	" Look here , everybody , my opinion 's this : we need n't look farther for the author of these deaths than the diningroom at this minute . I 'd take my oath that woman 's the one we 're after ! "
43765	43770	43715	43715	He	157	" And the motive ? "
43771	43782	43783	43783	Armstrong	86	" Religious mania . What do you say , doctor ? "
43786	43808	43783	43783	Armstrong	86	" It 's perfectly possible . I 've nothing to say against it . But of course we 've no proof . "
43812	43828	43829	43829	She	125	" She was very odd in the kitchen when we were getting breakfast . Her eyes "
43835	43855	43832	43832	Lombard	71	" You ca n't judge her by that . We 're all a bit off our heads by now ! "
43859	43891	43856	43856	Blore	157	" There 's another thing . She 's the only one who would n't give an explanation after that gramophone record . Why ? Because she had n't any to give . "
43901	43913	43898	43898	She	125	" That 's not quite true . She told me afterwards . "
43917	43927	43914	43914	Wargrave	55	" What did she tell you , Miss Claythorne ? "
43941	43986	43936	43938	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" A perfectly straightforward story . I personally should have no difficulty in accepting it . Tell me , Miss Claythorne , did she appear to be troubled by a sense of guilt or a feeling of remorse for her attitude in the matter ? "
43987	43991	43993	43993	Vera	125	" None whatever , "
43995	44001	44002	44002	Blore	157	" She was completely unmoved . "
44005	44020	44002	44002	Blore	157	" Hearts as hard as flints , these righteous spinsters ! Envy , mostly ! "
44026	44047	44021	44023	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" It is now five minutes to eleven . I think we should summon Miss Brent to join our conclave . "
44051	44061	44048	44048	Blore	157	" Are n't you going to take any action ? "
44066	44113	44062	44063	The judge	338	" I fail to see what action we can take . Our suspicions are , at the moment , only suspicions . I will , however , ask Dr. Armstrong to observe Miss Brent 's demeanour very carefully . Let us now go into the diningroom . "
44170	44178	44167	44167	Blore	157	" My God , she 's dead ! "
44189	44198	44184	44186	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" One more of us acquitted too late ! "
44225	44243	44221	44221	Lombard	71	" How did she die , doctor ? She was all right when we left her here ! "
44263	44273	44260	44260	He	86	" That 's the mark of a hypodermic syringe . "
44286	44300	44283	44283	Vera	125	" Look a bee a bumblebee . Remember what I said this morning ! "
44305	44322	44301	44301	Armstrong	86	" It was n't that bee that stung her ! A human hand held the syringe . "
44327	44333	44334	44334	Armstrong	86	" What poison was injected ? "
44337	44365	44334	44334	Armstrong	86	" At a guess , one of the cyanides . Probably Potassium Cyanide , same as Anthony Marston . She must have died almost immediately by asphyxiation . "
44369	44380	44366	44366	Vera	125	" But that bee ? It ca n't be coincidence ? "
44385	44424	44381	44381	Lombard	71	" Oh , no , it is n't coincidence ! It 's our murderer 's touch of local colour ! He 's a playful beast . Likes to stick to his damnable nursery jingle as closely as possible ' "
44466	44478	44462	44462	He	86	" It 's mad ! absolutely mad we 're all mad ! "
44484	44507	44479	44480	The judge	338	" We have still , I hope , our reasoning powers . Did any one bring a hypodermic syringe to this house ? "
44525	44531	44512	44512	himself	86	" Yes , I did . "
44555	44565	44552	44552	He	86	" Always travel with one . Most doctors do . "
44572	44589	44566	44568	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" Quite so . Will you tell us , doctor , where that syringe is now ? "
44590	44598	44599	44599	Wargrave	55	" In the suitcase in my room . "
44602	44612	44599	44599	Wargrave	55	" We might , perhaps , verify that fact . "
44647	44654	44643	44643	Armstrong	86	" Somebody must have taken it ! "
44696	44707	44685	44685	He	86	" I tell you some one must have taken it . "
44722	44781	44718	44719	The judge	338	" There are five of us here in this room . One of us is a murderer . The position is fraught with grave danger . Everything must be done in order to safeguard the four of us who are innocent . I will now ask you , Dr. Armstrong , what drugs you have in your possession ? "
44785	44831	44782	44782	Armstrong	86	" I have a small medicine case here . You can examine it . You will find some sleeping stuff trional and sulphonal tablets a packet of bromide , bicarbonate of soda , aspirin . Nothing else . I have no cyanide in my possession . "
44836	44878	44832	44833	The judge	338	" I have , myself , some sleeping tablets sulphonal , I think they are . I presume they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given . You , Mr. Lombard , have in your possession a revolver . "
44884	44890	44879	44880	Philip Lombard	71	" What if I have ? "
44891	44957	44958	44958	Lombard	71	" Only this . I propose that the doctor 's supply of drugs , my own sulphonal tablets , your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms should be collected together and placed in a safe place . That after this is done , we should each of us submit to a search both of our persons and of our effects . "
44961	44973	44958	44958	Lombard	71	" I 'm damned if I 'll give up my revolver ! "
44978	45070	44974	44974	Wargrave	55	" Mr. Lombard , you are a very strongly built and powerful young man , but ex Inspector Blore is also a man of powerful physique . I do not know what the outcome of a struggle between you would be but I can tell you this . On Blore 's side , assisting him to the best of our ability will be myself , Dr. Armstrong and Miss Claythorne . You will appreciate , therefore , that the odds against you if you choose to resist will be somewhat heavy . "
45087	45103	45077	45077	His	71	" Oh , very well then . Since you 've got it all taped out . "
45111	45126	45108	45108	his	55	" You are a sensible young man . Where is this revolver of yours ? "
45127	45138	45077	45077	His	71	" In the drawer of the table by my bed . "
45139	45142	45077	45077	His	71	" Good . "
45143	45149	45077	45077	His	71	" I 'll fetch it . "
45150	45163	45164	45164	Philip	71	" I think it would be desirable if we went with you . "
45176	45184	45164	45164	Philip	71	" Suspicious devil , are n't you ? "
45222	45225	45227	45227	Lombard	71	" Satisfied ? "
45297	45332	45333	45333	Vera	125	" I hope you will understand . Miss Claythorne , that we can make no exceptions . That revolver must be found . You have , I presume , a bathing dress with you ? "
45336	45359	45333	45333	Vera	125	" Then I will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us here . "
45389	45409	45385	45385	Wargrave	55	" Thank you , Miss Claythorne . Now if you will remain here , we will search your room . "
45440	45502	45436	45437	The judge	338	" We are now assured of one thing . There are no lethal weapons or drugs in the possession of any of us five . That is one point to the good . We will now place the drugs in a safe place . There is , I think , a silver chest , is there not , in the pantry ? "
45506	45526	45503	45503	Blore	157	" That 's all very well , but who 's to have the key ? You , I suppose . "
45627	45698	45624	45624	He	338	" You two are the strongest physically . It would be difficult for either of you to get the key from the other . It would be impossible for any of us three to do so . To break open the cupboard or the plate chest would be a noisy and cumbrous proceeding and one which could hardly be carried out without attention being attracted to what was going on . "
45706	45726	45699	45699	He	338	" We are still faced by one very grave problem . What has become of Mr. Lombard 's revolver ? "
45730	45745	45727	45727	Blore	157	" Seems to me its owner is the most likely person to know that . "
45759	45775	45756	45756	He	338	" You damned pigheaded fool ! I tell you it 's been stolen from me ! "
45779	45787	45776	45776	Wargrave	55	" When did you see it last ? "
45788	45808	45809	45810	The judge	338	" Last night . It was in the drawer when I went to bed ready in case anything happened . "
45816	45839	45813	45813	He	338	" It must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for Rogers or after his dead body was discovered . "
45843	45859	45840	45840	Vera	125	" It must be hidden somewhere about the house . We must look for it . "
45873	45907	45870	45870	He	55	" I doubt if our search will result in anything . Our murderer has had plenty of time to devise a hidingplace . I do not fancy we shall find that revolver easily . "
45912	45939	45908	45908	Blore	157	" I do n't know where the revolver is , but I 'll bet I know where something else is that hypodermic syringe . Follow me . "
45986	46023	45979	45979	Blore	157	" Only place it could be . After he 'd killed her , he opened the window and threw out the syringe and picked up the china figure from the table and followed on with that . "
46045	46054	46038	46038	Vera	125	" Now let us look for the revolver . "
46060	46089	46055	46057	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" By all means . But in doing so let us be careful to keep together . Remember , if we separate , the murderer gets his chance . "
46113	46126	46144	46146	five frightened people	1331	" One of us ... One of us ... One of us ... "
46462	46494	46495	46495	Blore	157	" We we should n't just sit here doing nothing ! There must be something surely , surely , there is something that we can do ? If we lit a bonfire "
46499	46504	46495	46495	Blore	157	" In this weather ? "
46573	46599	46570	46570	Lombard	71	" It 's only a question of time . The weather will clear . Then we can do something signallight fires make a raft something ! "
46609	46628	46600	46600	Armstrong	86	" A question of time time ? We ca n't afford time ! We shall all be dead ... "
46645	46658	46635	46635	his	55	" Not if we are careful . We must be very careful ... "
46758	46886	47238	47238	She	125	" It 's Armstrong ... I saw him looking at me sideways just then ... his eyes are mad ... quite mad ... Perhaps he is n't a doctor at all ... That 's it , of course ! ... He 's a lunatic , escaped from some doctor 's house pretending to be a doctor ... It 's true ... shall I tell them ? ... Shall I scream out ? ... No , it wo n't do to put him on his guard ... Besides he can seem so sane ... What time is it ? ... Only a quarter past three ! ... Oh , God , I shall go mad myself ... Yes , it 's Armstrong ... He 's watching me now ... "
46887	46954	47238	47238	She	125	" They wo n't get me ! I can take care of myself ... I 've been in tight places before ... Where the hell is that revolver ? ... Who took it ? ... Who 's got it ? ... Nobody 's got it we know that . We were all searched ... Nobody can have it ... But some one knows where it is ... "
46955	47028	47238	47238	She	125	" They 're going mad ... they 're all go mad ... Afraid of death ... we 're all afraid of death ... I 'm afraid of death ... Yes , but that does n't stop death coming ... ' The hearse is at the door , sir . ' Where did I read that ? The girl ... I 'll watch the girl . Yes , I 'll watch the girl ... "
47029	47132	47238	47238	She	125	" Twenty to four ... only twenty to four ... perhaps the clock has stopped ... I do n't understand no , I do n't understand ... This sort of thing ca n't happen ... it is happening ... Why do n't we wake up ? Wake up Judgement Day not that ! If I could only think ... My head something 's happening in my head it 's going to burst it 's going to split ... This sort of thing ca n't happen ... What 's the time ? Oh , God ! it 's only a quarter to four . "
47133	47196	47238	47238	She	125	" I must keep my head ... I must keep my head ... If only I keep my head ... It 's all perfectly clear all worked out . But nobody must suspect . It may do the trick . It must ! Which one ? That 's the question which one ? I think yes , I rather think yes him . "
47209	47216	47206	47206	Vera	125	" Does any one want tea ? "
47227	47234	47224	47224	Blore	157	" I 'd like a cup . "
47241	47255	47238	47238	She	125	" I 'll go and make it . You can all stay here . "
47262	47283	47256	47258	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" I think , my dear young lady , we would all prefer to come and watch you make it . "
47298	47305	47295	47295	She	125	" Of course ! You would ! "
47350	47357	47342	47343	The judge	338	" We must be very careful ... "
47390	47412	47387	47387	He	71	" Of course ! The engine 's not been run today since Rogers has n't been there to see to it . "
47418	47431	47413	47413	He	71	" We could go out and get it going , I suppose . "
47437	47455	47432	47434	Mr. Justice Wargrave	55	" There are packets of candles in the larder , I saw them , better use those . "
47692	47704	47718	47722	Horrid whiny spoilt little brat	1368	" Can I swim out to the island , Miss Claythorne ? "
47705	47717	47718	47722	Horrid whiny spoilt little brat	1368	" Why ca n't I swim out to the island ? ... "
47794	47801	47805	47805	herself	125	" Do n't be a fool , "
47807	47844	47805	47805	herself	125	" It 's all right . The others are downstairs . All four of them . There 's no one in the room . There ca n't be . You 're imagining things , my girl . "
47984	47989	47978	47978	men	817	" What the devil ? "
47990	47995	47978	47978	men	817	" What 's happened ? "
47996	48004	48005	48005	She	125	" Good God , what is it ? "
48048	48056	48031	48032	some one	608	" My God , look at that ! "
48148	48162	48145	48145	She	125	" It was seaweed only seaweed and that 's what the smell was ... "
48255	48262	48251	48251	She	125	" Where did this come from ? "
48278	48285	48275	48275	He	157	" I got it from downstairs . "
48289	48296	48286	48286	Vera	125	" I wo n't drink it ... "
48313	48351	48308	48308	He	71	" Good for you , Vera ! You 've got your wits about you even if you have been scared half out of your life . I 'll get a fresh bottle that has n't been opened . "
48361	48374	48357	48357	Vera	125	" I 'm all right now . I 'll have some water . "
48416	48423	48412	48412	Blore	157	" That brandy 's all right . "
48427	48433	48424	48424	Armstrong	86	" How do you know ? "
48438	48458	48434	48434	Blore	157	" I did n't put anything in it . That 's what you 're getting at , I suppose . "
48462	48490	48459	48459	Armstrong	86	" I 'm not saying you did . You might have done it , or some one might have tampered with the bottle for just this emergency . "
48523	48535	48536	48536	He	71	" There you are , my girl . Absolutely no deception . "
48547	48565	48566	48566	Vera	125	" Lucky there 's a good supply of spirits in the house . Thoughtful of U.N. Owen . "
48585	48602	48582	48582	He	71	" You 'd better drink this , Miss Claythorne . You 've had a nasty shock . "
48626	48641	48619	48620	Philip Lombard	71	" Well , here 's one murder that has n't gone according to plan ! "
48649	48658	48642	48642	Vera	125	" You think that was what was meant ? "
48662	48682	48659	48659	Lombard	71	" Expected you to pass out through fright ! Some people would have , would n't they , doctor ? "
48693	48713	48689	48689	He	86	" H'm , impossible to say . Young healthy subject no cardiac weakness . Unlikely . On the other hand "
48747	48754	48743	48743	He	86	" H'm , tastes all right . "
48763	48782	48760	48760	He	157	" If you 're saying that I tampered with that , I 'll knock your ruddy block off . "
48798	48804	48783	48783	Vera	125	" Where 's the judge ? "
48813	48825	48810	48811	each other	325	" That 's odd ... Thought he came up with us . "
48829	48848	48826	48826	Blore	157	" So did I ... What about it , doctor ? You came up the stairs behind me . "
48852	48880	48849	48849	Armstrong	86	" I thought he was following me ... Of course , he 'd be bound to go slower than we did . He 's an old man . "
48891	48897	48888	48888	Lombard	71	" It 's damned odd ... "
48901	48908	48909	48909	He	157	" We must look for him . "
48935	48946	48929	48929	Armstrong	86	" Of course he may have stayed in the livingroom ... "
48957	48966	48952	48952	Armstrong	86	" Wargrave , Wargrave , where are you ? "
49179	49185	49166	49166	He	86	" He 's been shot ... "
49189	49194	49195	49196	The doctor	287	" God the revolver ! "
49206	49215	49195	49196	The doctor	287	" Got him through the head . Instantaneous . "
49232	49240	49222	49222	She	125	" Miss Brent 's missing grey wool ... "
49244	49256	49241	49241	Blore	157	" And the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroom ... "
49260	49270	49257	49257	Vera	125	" So this is what they wanted them for ... "
49280	49366	49367	49367	His	1402	" Five little Indian boys going in for law ; one got in Chancery and then there were four . That 's the end of Mr. Bloody Justice Wargrave . No more pronouncing sentence for him ! No more putting on of the black cap ! Here 's the last time he 'll ever sit in court ! No more summing up and sending innocent men to death . How Edward Seton would laugh if he were here ! God , how he 'd laugh ! "
49378	49389	49375	49375	Vera	125	" Only this morning you said he was the one ! "
49404	49430	49397	49397	He	71	" I know I did ... Well , I was wrong . Here 's one more of us who 's been proved innocent too late ! "
49472	49479	49468	49468	Blore	157	" What do we do now ? "
49484	49499	49480	49480	Lombard	71	" Have something to eat . We 've got to eat , you know . "
49527	49535	49524	49524	Vera	125	" I shall never eat tongue again . "
49555	49568	49552	49552	Blore	157	" Only four of us now ... Who 'll be the next ? "
49578	49584	49572	49572	He	86	" We must be very careful "
49591	49604	49588	49588	Blore	157	" That 's what he said ... And now he 's dead ! "
49608	49617	49605	49605	Armstrong	86	" How did it happen , I wonder ? "
49624	49676	49621	49621	He	71	" A damned clever double cross ! That stuff was planted in Miss Claythorne 's room and it worked just as it was intended to . Every one dashes up there thinking she 's being murdered . And so in the confusion some one caught the old boy off his guard . "
49680	49690	49677	49677	Blore	157	" Why did n't any one hear the shot ? "
49696	49723	49724	49724	He	71	" Miss Claythorne was screaming , the wind was howling , we were running about and calling out . No , it would n't be heard . "
49727	49748	49724	49724	He	71	" But that trick 's not going to work again . He 'll have to try something else next time . "
49752	49757	49749	49749	Blore	157	" He probably will . "
49777	49789	49774	49774	Armstrong	86	" Four of us , and we do n't know which ... "
49793	49797	49790	49790	Blore	157	" I know ... "
49801	49809	49798	49798	Vera	125	" I have n't the least doubt ... "
49814	49822	49810	49810	Armstrong	86	" I suppose I do know really ... "
49827	49839	49823	49824	Philip Lombard	71	" I think I 've got a pretty good idea now ... "
49857	49873	49854	49854	She	125	" I feel awful . I must go to bed ... I 'm dead beat . "
49877	49889	49874	49874	Lombard	71	" Might as well . No good sitting watching each other . "
49893	49899	49890	49890	Blore	157	" I 've no objection ... "
49904	49920	49900	49901	The doctor	287	" The best thing to do although I doubt if any of us will sleep . "
49930	49940	49927	49927	Blore	157	" I wonder where that revolver is now ? ... "
50065	50077	50059	50059	He	71	" Yes , this business has got you rattled all right . "
50169	50205	50162	50162	She	125	" You 're all right until morning . Nothing happened last night . Nothing will happen tonight . Nothing can happen . You 're locked and bolted in . No one can come near you ... "
50211	50250	50207	50207	she	125	" Of course ! I can stay here ! Stay here locked in ! Food does n't really matter ! I can stay here safely till help comes ! Even if it 's a day or two days ... "
50306	50328	50331	50331	her	125	" Miss Claythorne , why ca n't I swim out to the rock ? I can . I know I can . "
50337	50351	50331	50331	her	125	" Of course you can , Cyril , really . I know that . "
50352	50361	50291	50291	she	125	" Can I go then , Miss Claythorne ? "
50362	50434	50331	50331	her	125	" Well , you see , Cyril , your mother gets so nervous about you . I 'll tell you what . Tomorrow you can swim out to the rock . I 'll talk to your mother on the beach and distract her attention . And then , when she looks for you , there you 'll be standing on the rock waving to her ! It will be a surprise ! "
50435	50450	50451	50451	She	1423	" Oh , good egg , Miss Claythorne ! That will be a lark ! "
50502	50531	50498	50498	he	69	" Miss Claythorne said I could ... Well , what of it ? One must take some risk ! If the worst happened she 'd brazen it out . "
50552	50881	50545	50545	I	0	" They 'd believe her all right . Cyril often told stories . He was an untruthful child . Cyril would know , of course . But that did n't matter ... And anyway nothing would go wrong . She 'd pretend to swim out after him . But she 'd arrive too late ... Nobody would ever suspect ... Had Hugo suspected ? Was that why he had looked at her in that queer faroff way ... ? Had Hugo known ? Was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly ? He had n't answered the one letter she had written to him ... Hugo ... Vera turned restlessly in bed . No , no , she must n't think of Hugo . It hurt too much ! That was all over , over and done with ... Hugo must be forgotten ... Why , this evening , had she suddenly felt that Hugo was in the room with her ? She stared up at the ceiling , stared at the big black hook in the middle of the room . She 'd never noticed that hook before . The seaweed had hung from that ... She shivered as she remembered that cold clammy touch on her neck ... She did n't like that hook on the ceiling . It drew your eyes , fascinated you ... a big black hook ... Ex - Inspector Blore sat on the side of his bed . His small eyes , redrimmed and bloodshot , were alert in the solid mass of his face . He was like a wild boar waiting to charge . He felt no inclination to sleep . The menace was coming very near now ... Six out of ten ! For all his sagacity , for all his caution and astuteness , the old judge had gone the way of the rest . Blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction . "
50891	50892	50885	50887	the old geezer	1425	" "
50899	52103	50885	50887	the old geezer	1425	" Selfrighteous smug old hypocrite . Sitting up in court feeling like God Almighty . He 'd got his all right ... No more being careful for him . And now there were four of them . The girl , Lombard , Armstrong and himself . Very soon another of them would go ... But it would n't be William Henry Blore . He 'd see to that all right . ( But the revolver ... What about the revolver ? That was the disturbing factor the revolver ! ) Blore sat on his bed , his brow furrowed , his little eyes creased and puckered while he pondered the problem of the revolver ... In the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs . Midnight . He relaxed a little now even went so far as to lie down on his bed . But he did not undress . He lay there , thinking . Going over the whole business from the beginning , methodically , painstakingly , as he had been wo nt to do in his police officer days . It was thoroughness that paid in the end . The candle was burning down . Looking to see if the matches were within easy reach of his hand , he blew it out . Strangely enough , he found the darkness disquieting . It was as though a thousand ageold fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain . Faces floated in the air the judge 's face crowned with that mockery of grey wool the cold dead face of Mrs. Rogers the convulsed purple face of Anthony Marston ... Another face pale , spectacled , with a small strawcoloured moustache ... A face he had seen sometime or other but when ? Not on the island . No , much longer ago than that . Funny , that he could n't put a name to it ... Silly sort of face really fellow looked a bit of a mug . Of course ! It came to him with a real shock . Landor ! Odd to think he 'd completely forgotten what Landor looked like . Only yesterday he 'd been trying to recall the fellow 's face , and had n't been able to . And now here it was , every feature clear and distinct , as though he had seen it only yesterday ... Landor had had a wife a thin slip of a woman with a worried face . There 'd been a kid too , a girl about fourteen . For the first time , he wondered what had become of them ... ( The revolver . What had become of the revolver ? That was much more important ... ) The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was ... He did n't understand this revolver business ... Somebody in the house had got that revolver ... Downstairs a clock struck one . Blore 's thoughts were cut short . He sat up on the bed , suddenly alert . For he had heard a sound a very faint sound somewhere outside his bedroom door . There was some one moving about in the darkened house . The perspiration broke out on his forehead . Who was it , moving secretly and silently along the corridors ? Some one who was up to no good , he 'd bet that ! Noiselessly , in spite of his heavy build , he dropped off the bed and with two strides was standing by the door listening . But the sound did not come again . Nevertheless Blore was convinced that he was not mistaken . He had heard a footfall just outside his door . The hair rose slightly on his scalp . He knew fear again ... Some one creeping about stealthily in the night ... He listened but the sound was not repeated . And now a new temptation assailed him . He wanted , desperately , to go out and investigate . If he could only see who it was prowling about in the darkness . But to open his door would be the action of a fool . Very likely that was exactly what the other was waiting for . He might even have meant Blore to hear what he had heard , counting on him coming out to investigate . Blore stood rigid , listening . He could hear sounds everywhere now , cracks , rustles , mysterious whispers but his dogged realistic brain knew them for what they were the creations of his own heated imagination . And then suddenly he heard something that was not imagination . Footsteps , very soft , very cautious , but plainly audible to a man listening with all his ears as Blore was listening . They came softly along the corridor ( both Lombard 's and Armstrong 's rooms were farther from the stairhead than his ) . They passed his door without hesitating or faltering . And as they did so , Blore made up his mind . He meant to see who it was ! The footsteps had definitely passed his door going to the stairs . Where was the man going ? When Blore acted , he acted quickly , surprisingly so for a man who looked so heavy and slow . He tiptoed back to the bed , slipped matches into his pocket , detached the plug of the electric lamp by his bed , and picked it up winding the flex round it . It was a chromium affair with a heavy ebonite base a useful weapon . He sprinted noiselessly across the room , removed the chair from under the door handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted the door . He stepped out into the corridor . There was a faint sound in the hall below ; Blore ran noiselessly in his stockinged feet to the head of the stairs . At that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so clearly . The wind had died down completely and the sky must have cleared . There was faint moonlight coming in through the landing window and it illuminated the hall below . Blore had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure just passing out through the front door . In the act of running down the stairs in pursuit , he paused . Once again , he had nearly made a fool of himself ! This was a trap , perhaps , to lure him out of the house ! But what the other man did n't realize was that he had made a mistake , had delivered himself neatly into Blore 's hands . For , of the three tenanted rooms upstairs , one must now be empty . All that had to be done was to ascertain which ! Blore went swiftly back along the corridor . He paused first at Dr. Armstrong 's door and tapped . There was no answer . He waited a minute , then went on to Philip Lombard 's room . Here the answer came at once . "
52108	52109	52110	52110	It	1428	" "
52128	52147	52148	52149	Miss Claythorne	125	" He went on to the door at the end of the corridor . Here he tapped again . "
52154	52164	52151	52152	Miss Claythorne	125	" Vera 's voice , startled , answered him : "
52174	52175	52181	52182	Miss Claythorne	125	" "
52193	52249	52188	52188	I	0	" He raced back to Lombard 's room . The door opened as he did so . Lombard stood there . He held a candle in his left hand . He had pulled on his trousers over his pyjamas . His right hand rested in the pocket of his pyjama jacket . He said sharply : "
52257	52268	52269	52269	Armstrong	86	" Blore explained rapidly . Lombard 's eyes lit up . "
52278	52287	52273	52273	he	86	" He moved along to Armstrong 's door . "
52301	52309	52310	52311	Armstrong Armstrong	1432	" He rapped sharply on the panel . "
52313	52343	52310	52311	Armstrong Armstrong	1432	" There was no answer . Lombard dropped to his knees and peered through the keyhole . He inserted his little finger gingerly into the lock . He said : "
52354	52358	52310	52311	Armstrong Armstrong	1432	" Blore said : "
52373	52377	52361	52361	he	86	" Philip nodded : "
52402	52411	52412	52412	Vera	125	" He raced along to Vera 's room . "
52414	52415	52412	52412	Vera	125	" "
52418	52419	52412	52412	Vera	125	" "

52451	52452	52448	52448	I	0	" "
52493	52497	52454	52454	Armstrong	86	" Vera said : "
52507	52511	52500	52500	I	0	" Lombard said : "
52514	52522	52500	52500	I	0	" He joined Blore . He said : "
52533	52537	52538	52538	We	1435	" Blore said : "
52552	52564	52544	52544	He	86	" Philip Lombard raced down the stairs chuckling . He said : "
52572	52581	52568	52568	you	1436	" He undid the front door , remarking : "
52594	52599	52568	52568	you	1436	" He went on : "
52606	52619	52600	52600	I	0	" He took it half out of his pocket as he spoke . "
52629	52650	52600	52600	I	0	" Blore stopped dead on the doorstep . His face changed . Philip Lombard saw it . He said impatiently : "
52684	52708	52678	52678	I	0	" He started off into the moonlight . Blore , after a minute 's hesitation , followed him . He thought to himself : "
52720	53202	53203	53203	Vera	125	" After all he had tackled criminals armed with revolvers before now . Whatever else he lacked , Blore did not lack courage . Show him the danger and he would tackle it pluckily . He was not afraid of danger in the open , only of danger undefined and tinged with the supernatural . Vera , left to wait results , got up and dressed . She glanced over once or twice at the door . It was a good solid door . It was both bolted and locked and had an oak chair wedged under the handle . It could not be broken open by force . Certainly not by Dr. Armstrong . He was not a physically powerful man . If she were Armstrong intent on murder , it was cunning that she would employ , not force . She amused herself by reflecting on the means he might employ . He might , as Philip had suggested , announce that one of the other two men was dead . Or he might possibly pretend to be mortally wounded himself , might drag himself groaning to her door . There were other possibilities . He might inform her that the house was on fire . More , he might actually set the house on fire ... Yes , that would be a possibility . Lure the other two men out of the house , then , having previously laid a trail of petrol , he might set light to it . And she , like an idiot , would remain barricaded in her room until it was too late . She crossed over to the window . Not too bad . At a pinch one could escape that way . It would mean a drop but there was a handy flowerbed . She sat down and picking up her diary began to write in it in a clear flowing hand . One must pass the time . Suddenly she stiffened to attention . She had heard a sound . It was , she thought , a sound like breaking glass . And it came from somewhere downstairs . She listened hard , but the sound was not repeated . She heard , or thought she heard , stealthy sounds of footsteps , the creak of stairs , the rustle of garments but there was nothing definite , and she concluded , as Blore had done earlier , that such sounds had their origin in her own imagination . But presently she heard sounds of a more concrete nature . People moving about downstairs the murmur of voices . Then the very decided sound of some one mounting the stairs doors opening and shutting feet going up to the attics overhead . More noises from there . Finally the steps came along the passage . Lombard 's voice said : "
53209	53210	53205	53205	You	125	" "
53217	53223	53225	53225	you	125	" Blore 's voice said : "
53230	53279	53225	53225	you	125	" Vera went to the door . She removed the chair , unlocked the door and slid back the bolt . She opened the door . The two men were breathing hard , their feet and the bottom of their trousers were soaking wet . She said again : "
53284	53288	53289	53289	Armstrong	86	" Lombard said : "
53293	53297	53289	53289	Armstrong	86	" Vera cried : "
53300	53304	53289	53289	Armstrong	86	" Lombard said : "
53311	53315	53289	53289	Armstrong	86	" Blore concurred : "
53328	53333	53289	53289	Armstrong	86	" Vera said impatiently : "
53341	53345	53348	53348	he	86	" Blore said : "
53393	53397	53398	53398	He	86	" Vera said : "
53405	53409	53398	53398	He	86	" Blore said : "
53445	53450	53451	53451	I	0	" Vera said incredulously : "
53457	53461	53451	53451	I	0	" Lombard said : "
53469	53476	53451	53451	I	0	" He paused and then said : "
53505	53610	53497	53500	three little Indian boys	496	" Chapter 15 . Three people sat eating breakfast in the kitchen . Outside , the sun shone . It was a lovely day . The storm was a thing of the past . And with the change in the weather , a change had come in the mood of the prisoners on the island . They felt now like people just awakening from a nightmare . There was danger , yet , but it was danger in daylight . That paralyzing atmosphere of fear that had wrapped them round like a blanket yesterday while the wind howled outside was gone . Lombard said : "
53673	53677	53661	53661	they	1450	" Vera said : "
53700	53704	53687	53687	they	1450	" Lombard said : "

53786	53795	53796	53796	We	1442	" Blore cleared his throat . He said : "

54500	54506	54495	54498	a pair of idiots	1469	" Lombard looked at her . "
54511	54515	54495	54498	a pair of idiots	1469	" Vera said : "
54533	54541	54542	54545	Four little Indian boys	493	" She recited in a meaning voice : "
54562	54567	54551	54553	A red herring	495	" She went on : "
54619	54628	54629	54629	You	97	" Lombard sat down again . He said : "

54913	55018	54890	54890	you	86	" They spent the morning on the cliffs , taking it in turns to flash a mirror at the mainland . There were no signs that any one saw them . No answering signals . The day was fine , with a slight haze . Below , the sea weaved in a gigantic swell . There were no boats out . They had made another abortive search of the island . There was no trace of the missing physician . Vera looked up at the house from where they were standing . She said , her breath coming with a slight catch in it : "
55040	55044	55065	55065	him	270	" Lombard said : "
55071	55075	55056	55057	no one	2220	" Vera said : "
55081	55085	55056	55057	no one	2220	" Blore said : "
55104	55108	55109	55109	I	0	" Vera shuddered , "
55123	55127	55115	55115	I	0	" Philip said : "
55138	55142	55128	55128	You	0	" Vera murmured : "
55147	55156	55128	55128	You	0	" She stretched out her hands , murmuring : "
55166	55170	55128	55128	You	0	" She thought : "
55213	55224	55205	55205	I	0	" Blore was looking at his wristwatch . He said : "
55234	55239	55240	55240	I	0	" Vera said obstinately : "
55259	55260	55249	55249	I	0	" "
55279	55283	55276	55276	you	125	" Vera said : "

55339	55343	55334	55334	you	125	" Philip said : "
55366	55373	55363	55364	Miss Claythorne	125	" Blore hesitated . Vera said : "
55405	55409	55385	55385	he	0	" Blore said : "
55428	55432	55433	55433	You	125	" Philip said : "

55464	55468	55460	55460	you	125	" said Blore . "
55474	55478	55469	55469	You	125	" Philip laughed . "
55501	55505	55489	55489	I	0	" Blore said : "
55536	55537	55594	55594	I	0	" "
55540	55544	55545	55545	you	125	" said Philip , "
55553	55554	55545	55545	you	125	" "
55558	55562	55545	55545	you	125	" said Blore , "
55574	55579	55606	55606	you	125	" Philip said softly : "
55608	55631	55606	55606	you	125	" Blore shrugged his shoulders and began to make his way up the steep slope to the house . Lombard said softly : "
55647	55652	55660	55660	he	1501	" Vera said anxiously : "
55664	55665	55660	55660	he	1501	" "
55730	55731	55723	55723	I	0	" "
55739	55744	55747	55747	Blore	93	" Philip said softly : "

55757	55758	55753	55753	you	125	" "
55853	55854	55845	55845	Armstrong	86	" "
55857	55863	55845	55845	Armstrong	86	" Lombard shrugged his shoulders . "
55941	55956	55931	55931	He	557	" Vera had gone rather white . She said in a slightly breathless voice : "
55963	55975	55931	55931	He	557	" Lombard said softly , patting the revolver in his pocket : "
55988	55996	55984	55984	he	557	" Then he looked at her curiously . "
56016	56020	56010	56010	I	0	" Vera said : "
56049	56056	56047	56047	Armstrong	86	" She turned to him suddenly . "
56076	56081	56070	56074	Some one watching and waiting	1516	" Lombard said slowly : "
56087	56092	56070	56074	Some one watching and waiting	1516	" Vera said eagerly : "
56099	56109	56094	56094	you	0	" She shivered . She bent a little closer . "
56116	56124	56112	56112	you	0	" She broke off , went on : "
56162	56171	56172	56173	Heavenly visitants	1522	" Lombard raised his eyebrows . He said : "
56193	56201	56203	56203	I	0	" Vera said in a low voice : "
56208	56217	56203	56203	I	0	" Lombard looked at her . He said : "
56222	56233	56235	56235	you	0	" After a moment 's silence he said very quietly : "
56243	56248	56249	56249	I	0	" Vera said vehemently : "
56265	56270	56275	56275	you	0	" He laughed easily . "
56304	56328	56332	56335	a man in it	1525	" A sudden feeling of lassitude , of intense weariness , spread over Vera 's limbs . She said in a dull voice : "
56337	56342	56332	56335	a man in it	1525	" Lombard said softly : "
56353	56362	56348	56348	I	0	" Vera sat up suddenly . She exclaimed : "
56373	56377	56382	56382	Queer	147	" Lombard said : "
56405	56416	56402	56402	I	0	" They stared up at the house . Lombard said : "
56430	56431	56422	56422	We	1527	" "
56441	56442	56444	56444	yourself	0	" "
56449	56454	56446	56446	I	0	" Vera said desperately : "
56464	56544	56458	56458	I	0	" They walked up the slope to the house . The terrace was peaceful and innocuouslooking in the sunshine . They hesitated there a minute , then instead of entering by the front door , they made a cautious circuit of the house . They found Blore . He was spreadeagled on the stone terrace on the east side , his head crushed and mangled by a great block of white marble . Philip looked up . He said : "
56552	56561	56458	56458	I	0	" Vera said in a low shuddering voice : "
56585	56595	56458	56458	I	0	" She repeated and her voice shook and quavered : "
56603	56620	56458	56458	I	0	" Philip grasped her shoulder . He said , and his voice was urgent and grim : "
56641	56651	56634	56634	I	0	" But Vera clung to him . She cried : "
56681	56689	56675	56675	He	86	" Philip stopped . He said thoughtfully : "
56696	56700	56675	56675	He	86	" Vera cried : "
56713	56717	56709	56709	I	0	" He nodded . "
56747	56752	56737	56737	We	1532	" Vera said urgently : "
56773	56778	56762	56762	you	86	" Lombard said reluctantly : "
56782	56783	56762	56762	you	86	" "
56816	56817	56807	56808	a Priest	1535	" "
56828	56829	56830	56830	He	86	" "
56837	56847	56830	56830	He	86	" Philip Lombard shook his head . He said : "
56866	56870	56856	56856	I	0	" Vera said : "
56875	56879	56880	56880	I	0	" Lombard said : "
56885	56889	56880	56880	I	0	" Vera cried : "
56911	56924	56903	56903	He	86	" Lombard said , half bringing out the revolver from his pocket : "
56933	56934	56935	56935	You	0	" "
57001	57014	56989	56989	He	662	" Lombard put back the revolver in his pocket . He said : "
57020	57026	56989	56989	He	662	" Lombard said at last : "
57037	57048	57049	57049	You	0	" Vera did n't answer . He went on accusingly : "
57056	57061	57049	57049	You	0	" She said helplessly : "
57076	57082	57072	57072	I	0	" Philip Lombard said thoughtfully : "
57142	57146	57138	57138	I	0	" He paused : "
57159	57167	57147	57147	You	0	" Vera said with a raucous laugh : "
57179	57185	57170	57170	I	0	" Philip Lombard said quietly : "
57192	57200	57201	57201	I	0	" Vera moved restlessly . She said : "
57217	57218	57138	57138	I	0	" "
57222	57273	57138	57138	I	0	" They paced slowly up and down , along the line of the rocks overlooking the sea . The sun was dropping towards the west . The light was golden and mellow . It enveloped them in a golden glow . Vera said , with a sudden nervous little giggle : "
57282	57295	57138	57138	I	0	" Philip was looking down towards the sea . He said abruptly : "
57317	57324	57302	57302	You	0	" Vera stared . She said : "
57332	57333	57334	57335	A bather	1548	" "
57339	57343	57334	57335	A bather	1548	" Lombard laughed . "
57353	57357	57334	57335	A bather	1548	" Vera said : "
57364	57365	57334	57335	A bather	1548	" "
57370	57379	57334	57335	A bather	1548	" said . Lombard as they drew nearer . "
57399	57413	57420	57421	a man	1874	" They scrambled over the rocks . Vera stopped suddenly . She said : "
57423	57468	57420	57421	a man	1874	" The man was wedged between two rocks , flung there by the tide earlier in the day . Lombard and Vera reached it in a last scramble . They bent down . A purple discoloured face a hideous drowned face ... Lombard said : "
57476	57550	57474	57474	Armstrong	86	" Chapter 16 . Aeons passed ... worlds span and whirled ... Time was motionless ... It stood still it passed through a thousand ages ... No , it was only a minute or so ... Two people were standing looking down on a dead man ... Slowly , very slowly , Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard lifted their heads and looked into each other 's eyes ... Lombard laughed . He said : "
57561	57565	57559	57559	Vera	125	" Vera said : "
57581	57593	57559	57559	Vera	125	" Her voice was a whisper nothing more . Lombard said : "
57607	57611	57605	57605	we	1554	" Vera said : "
57623	57629	57605	57605	we	1554	" He shrugged his shoulders . "
57641	57650	57653	57653	I	0	" Their eyes met again . Vera thought : "
57677	57690	57696	57696	you	0	" Lombard said , and his voice was a snarl dangerous menacing : "
57713	57718	57719	57719	I	0	" Vera said quietly : "
57722	57752	57719	57719	I	0	" She stared out to sea . General Macarthur had stared out to sea when only yesterday ? Or was it the day before ? He too had said , "
57758	57799	57800	57802	Poor Dr. Armstrong	86	" He had said it with acceptance almost with welcome . But to Vera the words the thought brought rebellion . No , it should not be the end . She looked down at the dead man . She said : "
57804	57811	57800	57802	Poor Dr. Armstrong	86	" Lombard sneered . He said : "
57819	57823	57800	57802	Poor Dr. Armstrong	86	" Vera said : "
57833	57837	57838	57838	I	0	" He said : "
57850	57862	57863	57863	We	1556	" Vera looked down again at the body . She said : "
57875	57876	57883	57883	I	0	" "
57904	57908	57897	57897	he	86	" Vera said : "
57924	57931	57933	57933	you	0	" Lombard laughed . He said : "
57936	57964	57933	57933	you	0	" He bent tugging at the body . Vera leaned against him , helping him . She pulled and tugged with all her might . Lombard panted : "
57971	57995	57933	57933	you	0	" They managed it , however , drawing the body clear of the high water mark . Lombard said as he straightened up : "
57998	58002	57933	57933	you	0	" Vera said : "
58005	58052	57933	57933	you	0	" Her tone warned him . He spun around . Even as he clapped his hand to his pocket he knew that he would find it empty . She had moved a yard or two and was facing him , revolver in hand . Lombard said : "
58070	58111	58063	58063	You	1560	" She nodded . She held it steadily and unwaveringly . Death was very near to Philip Lombard now . It had never , he knew , been nearer . Nevertheless he was not beaten yet . He said authoritatively : "
58118	58125	58063	58063	You	1560	" Vera laughed . Lombard said : "
58133	58176	58063	58063	You	1560	" His quick brain was working . Which way which method talk her over lull her into security or a swift dash All his life Lombard had taken the risky way . He took it now . He spoke slowly , argumentatively . "
58188	58547	58185	58185	you	2554	" And then he sprang . Quick as a panther as any other feline creature ... Automatically Vera pressed the trigger ... Lombard 's leaping body stayed poised in midspring , then crashed heavily to the ground . Vera came warily forward , the revolver ready in her hand . But there was no need of caution . Philip Lombard was dead shot through the heart ... Relief possessed Vera enormous exquisite relief . At last it was over . There was no more fear no more steeling of her nerves ... She was alone on the island ... Alone with nine dead bodies ... But what did that matter ? She was alive ... She sat there exquisitely happy exquisitely at peace ... No more fear ... The sun was setting when Vera moved at last . Sheer reaction had kept her immobile . There had been no room in her for anything but the glorious sense of safety . She realized now that she was hungry and sleepy . Principally sleepy . She wanted to throw herself on her bed and sleep and sleep and sleep ... Tomorrow , perhaps , they would come and rescue her but she did n't really mind . She did n't mind staying here . Not now that she was alone ... Oh ! blessed , blessed peace ... She got to her feet and glanced up at the house . Nothing to be afraid of any longer ! No terrors waiting for her ! Just an ordinary wellbuilt modern house . And yet , a little earlier in the day , she had not been able to look at it without shivering ... Fear what a strange thing fear was ... Well , it was over now . She had conquered had triumphed over the most deadly peril . By her own quickwittedness and adroitness she had turned the tables on her wouldbe destroyer . She began to walk up towards the house . The sun was setting , the sky to the west was streaked with red and orange . It was beautiful and peaceful ... Vera thought : "
58556	58633	58185	58185	you	2554	" How tired she was terribly tired . Her limbs ached , her eyelids were drooping . Not to be afraid any more ... To sleep . Sleep ... sleep ... sleep ... To sleep safely since she was alone on the island . One little Indian boy left all alone . She smiled to herself . She went in at the front door . The house , too , felt strangely peaceful . Vera thought : "
58652	58708	58709	58709	You	1563	" Should she go the kitchen and get herself something to eat ? She hesitated a moment , then decided against it . She was really too tired ... She paused by the diningroom door . There were still three little china figures in the middle of the table . Vera laughed . She said : "
58718	58760	58709	58709	You	1563	" She picked up two of them and tossed them out through the window . She heard them crash on the stone of the terrace . The third little figure she picked up and held in her hand . She said : "
58778	58814	58815	58818	One little Indian boy	501	" The hall was dim in the dying light . Vera , the little Indian clasped in her hand , began to mount the stairs . Slowly , because her legs were suddenly very tired . "
58823	58833	58815	58818	One little Indian boy	501	" How did it end ? Oh , yes ! "
58843	58879	58815	58818	One little Indian boy	501	" Married ... Funny , how she suddenly got the feeling again that Hugo was in the house ... Very strong . Yes , Hugo was upstairs waiting for her . Vera said to herself : "
58899	58974	58975	58978	One little Indian boy	501	" Slowly up the stairs ... At the top of them something fell from her hand , making hardly any noise on the soft pile carpet . She did not notice that she had dropped the revolver . She was only conscious of clasping a little china figure . How very quiet the house was . And yet it did n't seem like an empty house ... Hugo , upstairs , waiting for her ... "
59085	59145	59146	59146	You	692	" He went and hanged himself and then there were none ... The little china figure fell from her hand . It rolled unheeded and broke against the fender . Like an automaton Vera moved forward . This was the end here where the cold wet hand ( Cyril 's hand , of course ) had touched her throat ... "
59155	59234	59153	59153	Cyril	69	" That was what murder was as easy as that ! But afterwards you went on remembering ... She climbed up on the chair , her eyes staring in front of her like a sleepwalker 's ... She adjusted the noose round her neck . Hugo was there to see she did what she had to do . She kicked away the chair ... Epilogue . Sir Thomas Legge , Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard , said irritably : "
59242	59248	59249	59249	I	0	" Inspector Maine said respectfully : "
59254	59260	59249	59249	I	0	" The A.C. went on : "

59415	59423	59410	59411	Vera Claythorne	125	" The A.C. winced . He said : "
59430	59443	59410	59411	Vera Claythorne	125	" He considered for a minute or two . He said irritably : "
59473	59480	59481	59481	They	1583	" Inspector Maine shrugged his shoulders . "

59762	59773	59753	59753	he	74	" The other man sighed . Inspector Maine went on : "
59843	59853	59855	59855	you	1602	" Sir Thomas Legge stirred uneasily . He said : "
59872	59881	59855	59855	you	1602	" Maine shrugged his shoulders . He said : "
59965	59980	59981	59982	Fred Narracott	100	" The Assistant Commissioner admitted gloomily that he supposed it was . Maine said : "
60065	60066	60057	60057	he	100	" "
60076	60077	60057	60057	he	100	" "

60339	60345	60459	60459	He	55	" He cleared his throat . "
60357	60448	60459	60459	He	55	" Starting with the Rogerses who were the first to arrive on the island . They were in service with a Miss Brady who died suddenly . Ca n't get anything definite out of the doctor who attended her . He says they certainly did n't poison her , or anything like that , but his personal belief if that there was some funny business that she died as the result of neglect on their part . Says it 's the sort of thing that 's quite impossible to prove . "
60467	60526	60459	60459	He	55	" By the way , Seton was guilty unmistakably guilty . Evidence turned up later after he was hanged which proved that beyond any shadow of doubt . But there was a good deal of comment at the time nine people out of ten thought Seton was innocent and that the judge 's summing up had been vindictive . "
60591	60592	60615	60616	Wellknown man	1637	" "
60596	60610	60611	60612	Dr. Armstrong	86	" said the A.C. with a sigh . Maine took a deep breath . "
60726	60769	60775	60776	the A.C.	2867	" Then there 's Miss Emily Brent . Girl , Beatrice Taylor , was in service with her . Got pregnant , was turned out by her mistress and went and drowned herself . Not a nice business but again not criminal . "
60770	60773	60775	60776	the A.C.	2867	" That , "
60778	60797	60798	60798	Maine	174	" seems to be the point . U.N. Owen dealt with cases that the law could n't touch . "
60806	60879	60798	60798	Maine	174	" Young Marston was a fairly reckless car driver had his license endorsed twice and he ought to have been prohibited from driving , in my opinion . That 's all there is to him . The two names John and Lucy Combes were those of two kids he knocked down and killed near Cambridge . Some friends of his gave evidence for him and he was let off with a fine . "
60957	60958	60943	60944	commanding officers	1645	" "
60961	60965	60943	60944	commanding officers	1645	" said the A.C. "
61020	61027	61028	61028	Maine	174	" Then we come to Blore . "
61031	61041	61028	61028	Maine	174	" He of course was one of our lot . "
61047	61050	61052	61054	the Assistant Commissioner	2871	" Blore , "
61057	61063	61052	61054	the Assistant Commissioner	2871	" was a bad hat ! "
61064	61071	61072	61073	The A.C.	2867	" You think so , sir ? "
61076	61164	61072	61073	The A.C.	2867	" I always thought so . But he was clever enough to get away with it . It 's my opinion that he committed black perjury in the Landor case . I was n't happy about it at the time . But I could n't find anything . I put Hams onto it and he could n't find anything but I 'm still of the opinion that there was something to find if we 'd known how to set about it . The man was n't straight . "
61176	61191	61171	61173	Sir Thomas Legge	173	" And Isaac Morris is dead , you say ? When did he die ? "
61192	61241	61242	61242	Legge	173	" I thought you 'd soon come to that , sir . Isaac Morris died on the night of August 8th . Took an overdose of sleeping stuff one of the barbiturates , I understand . There was n't anything to show whether it was accident or suicide . "
61246	61256	61242	61242	Legge	173	" Care to know what I think , Maine ? "
61257	61265	61266	61266	Legge	173	" Perhaps I can guess , sir . "
61270	61283	61266	61266	Legge	173	" That death of Morris ' is a damned sight too opportune ! "
61291	61301	61288	61288	He	174	" I thought you 'd say that , sir . "
61320	61353	61316	61316	He	2871	" The whole thing 's fantastic impossible . Ten people killed on a bare rock of an island and we do n't know who did it , or why , or how . "
61360	61421	61357	61357	He	174	" Well , it 's not quite like that , sir . We do know why , more or less . Some fanatic with a bee in his bonnet about justice . He was out to get people who were beyond the reach of the law . He picked ten people whether they were really guilty or not does n't matter "
61430	61439	61440	61440	He	2871	" Does n't it ? It seems to me "
61456	61460	61461	61461	he	173	" Carry on , "
61464	61501	61502	61502	Maine	174	" Just for a minute I felt I 'd got somewhere . Got , as it were , the clue to the thing . It 's gone now . Go ahead with what you were saying . "
61506	61543	61502	61502	Maine	174	" There were ten people to be executed , let 's say . They were executed . U.N. Owen accomplished his task . And somehow or other he spirited himself off that island into thin air . "
61548	61565	61566	61566	Maine	174	" Firstclass vanishing trick . But you know , Maine , there must be an explanation . "
61569	61626	61566	61566	Maine	174	" You 're thinking , sir , that if the man was n't on the island , he couldn'l have left the island , and according to the account of the interested parties he never was on the island . Well , then the only explanation possible is that he was actually one of the ten . "
61635	61770	61631	61631	Maine	174	" We thought of that , sir . We went into it . Now , to begin with , we 're not quite in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island . Vera Claythorne kept a diary , so did Emily Brent . Old Wargrave made some notes dry legal cryptic stuff , but quite clear . And Blore made notes too . All those accounts tally . The deaths occurred in this order : Marston , Mrs. Rogers , Macarthur , Rogers , Miss Brent , Wargrave . After his death Vera Claythorne 's diary states that Armstrong left the house in the night and that Blore and Lombard had gone after him . Blore has one more entry in his notebook . Just two words : ' Armstrong disappeared . ' "
61840	62041	62042	62042	You	1660	" That was a good solution but it wo n't do . No , sir , it wo n't do . First of all there 's the police surgeon 's evidence . He got to the island early on the morning of August 13th . He could n't say much to help us . All he could say was that all the people had been dead at least thirtysix hours and probably a good deal longer . But he was fairly definite about Armstrong . Said he must have been from eight to ten hours in the water before his body was washed up . That works out at this , that Armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night of the 10th 11th and I 'll explain why . We found the point where the body was washed up it had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth , hair , etc . on them . It must have been deposited there at high water on the 11th that 's to say round about 11 o'clock A.M. After that , the storm subsided , and succeeding high water marks are considerably lower . "
62115	62135	62136	62136	He	0	" So that settles one point definitely . Some one was alive on the island after Armstrong was dead . "
62143	62242	62136	62136	He	0	" And that leaves just what exactly ? Here 's the position early on the morning of the 11th . Armstrong has ' disappeared ' ( drowned ) . That leaves us three people . Lombard , Blore and Vera Claythorne . Lombard was shot . His body was down by the sea near Armstrong 's . Vera Claythorne was found hanged in her own bedroom . Blore 's body was on the terrace . His head was crushed in by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window above . "
62248	62252	62243	62244	The A.C.	2867	" Whose window ? "
62253	62309	62243	62244	The A.C.	2867	" Vera Claythorne 's . Now , sir , let 's take each of these cases separately . First Philip Lombard . Let 's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto Blore then he doped Vera Claythorne and strung her up . Lastly , he went down to the seashore and shot himself . "
62345	62350	62362	62363	Vera Claythorne	125	" The A.C. said : "
62356	62357	62360	62360	sir	1891	" "
62366	62367	62362	62363	Vera Claythorne	125	" "
62374	62375	62376	62376	I	0	" "
62417	62474	62415	62415	herself	125	" And that 's quite all right up to a point . There 's a chair in her bedroom and on the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on her shoes . Looks as though she stood on the chair , adjusted the rope round her neck and kicked away the chair . "
62514	62610	62611	62613	The Assistant Commissioner	2871	" That leaves us with Blore and if you tell me that after shooting Lombard and inducing Vera Claythorne to hang herself he then went out and pulled down a whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it or something like that well , I simply do n't believe you . Men do n't commit suicide that way and what 's more Blore was n't that kind of man . We knew Blore and he was not the man that you 'd ever accuse of a desire for abstract justice . "
62616	62620	62611	62613	The Assistant Commissioner	2871	" I agree . "
62625	62693	62621	62622	Inspector Maine	174	" And therefore , sir , there must have been some one else on the island . Some one who tidied up when the whole business was over . But where was he all the time and where did he go to ? The Sticklehaven people are absolutely certain that no one could have left the island before the rescue boat got there . But in that case "
62702	62706	62697	62699	The Assistant Commissioner	2871	" In that case "
62719	62725	62726	62726	he	2871	" But in that case , "
62729	62734	62726	62726	he	2871	" who killed them ? "
64160	64189	64157	64157	He	1729	" You 're right . Murder is n't what most people think giving some one a dollop of arsenic pushing them over a cliff that sort of stuff . "
64203	64319	64200	64200	He	1729	" I 've known a murderess known her , I tell you . And what 's more I was crazy about her ... God help me , sometimes I think I still am ... It 's Hell , I tell you Hell You see , she did it more or less for me ... Not that I ever dreamed . Women are fiends absolute fiends you would n't think a girl like that a nice straight jolly girl you would n't think she 'd do that , would you ? That she 'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown you would n't think a woman could do a thing like that ? "
64325	64334	64335	64335	He	1730	" Are you sure she did do it ? "
64348	64394	64341	64341	he	1730	" I 'm quite sure . Nobody else ever thought of it . But I knew the moment I looked at her when I got back after ... And she knew I knew ... What she did n't realize was that I loved that kid ... "
65793	65800	65782	65782	he	86	" A red herring swallowed one ... "
66630	66633	66607	66608	the murderer	2488	" red herring "
